40 Ft	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/40_ft-lyrics-422591.html	Album: Franz Ferdinand	"As I glance once upon the foam
40 feet beneath my feet
The coldest calm falls
Through the molten veins
Cooling all the blood to slush
That congeals around the brain
La la la
40 feet remain
Salt scales upon my drying arms
Burn my back beneath the sun
But I am cold beneath the burning rays
Looking down, looking down
Down, down again
La la la
40 feet remain"

Bang bang, the first six are for you
Bang bang, the seventh is for me
Bang bang, Gavrilo Princip

Better On Holiday	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/better_on_holiday-lyrics-468831.html	-	"It's always better on holiday
That's why we only work when we need the money
Jacqueline was seventeen and working on the desk of the poetry library
When she caught the eye behind Ivor's spectacle
They shared tea, ideas and passions
His eyes forgot the face they were peering from
When they peered upon her face
Well, you know that face as well as I do:
Elastic youth and vitality, but when she returned the gaze
She returned the face that he was staring from
Gregor was down, kicked again and again by city centre neds
""Look, I'm so drunk, I don't give a fuck - I don't mind if you kill me""
At which point he claims angels dragged him into the back of a Ford Sierra
And dumped him on Sauchiehall Street"

In a place that I can't live
I kinda find I like a life
This lonely
It rips and pierces me
In places i cant see
I love the rip of nerves
The rip that wakes me
So I'm dissatisfied
I love dissatisfied
I love to feel there's always more that I need
So come on home
So come on home
So come on - home home
You're where you want to be
I'm where i want to be
Come on we're chasing
Everything we've ever wanted
Replace you easily
Replace pathetically
I flirt with every flighty thing
That falls my way
But how I needed you
When I needed you
Let's not forget
We are so strong
So bloody strong
Come on home
So come on home
So come on - home, home
Moon light falls
Upon your perfect skin
Falls and you draw back again
Falls and this is how I felt
And I cannot forget
And I cannot forget
Come on home
So come on home
But don't forget to leave"
Darts Of Pleasure	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/darts_of_pleasure-lyrics-422593.html	Album: Franz Ferdinand	"You are the latest contender
You are the one to remember
You are the villain who sends her
Light or dark, fantastic passion
I know that you will surrender
I know that you will surrender
I want this fantastic passion
We'll have fantastic passion
You can feel my lips undress your eyes
Undress your eyes, undress your eyes
Words of love and words so leisured
Words of poisoned darts of pleasure
Died... and so you died
You are the latest adventure
You're an emotion avenger
You are the devil that sells her
Light or dark, fantastic passion
I know that you will surrender
I know that you will surrender
I want this fantastic passion
We'll have fantastic passion
You can feel my lips undress your eyes
Undress your eyes, undress your eyes
Skin can feel my lips they tingle - tense anticipation
This one is an easy one, feel the word and melt upon it
Words of love and words so leisured
Words of poisoned darts of pleasure
Died and so you died

Don`t Start	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/dont_start-lyrics-453827.html	Album: Unreleased	"There's only wind and dust to follow
Your footsteps on the run
You know me, know when I'm without you
I swear my heart burns in the sun
Baby, don't start walking away
Stop walking away
Start coming around and around again
Don't start walking away
Stop walking away
Start coming around and around again
I see you in your glasses clearly
Your shades are blinding me, I say
I miss you most when you are with me
I miss your missing me each day
Baby, don't start walking away
Stop walking away
Start coming around and around again
Don't start walking away
Stop walking away
Start coming around and around again"
Dream Again	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/dream_again-lyrics-1303529.html	Album: Tonight: Franz Ferdinand	"Don't be afraid if you hear voices
Or feel the sweet air
Spoken upon you
Sometimes the sound
Of a thousand
Whispering words
Of Hope will reassure
Show me the future
Will see u s join together
If the oceans split
Or the mountains sigh
Then I
Will keep on dreaming
I live to dream again
Don't be afraid if you're descending
The deepest despairs
Without a handrail to guide you
Sometimes the sound
Of a thousand
Whispering words
Can confuse
But when you're sleeping
They shift and slide together
Bring meaning
To the canyon's cry
So I
I keep on dreaming
I live to dream again
Sometimes the sound
Of a thousand
Whispers are where
You live a little fear
But feel the pressure
I feel us dream together
I feel no fear
I feel no fire
Oh I
I keep on dreaming
I live to dream again"
Evil And A Heathen	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/evil_and_a_heathen-lyrics-433955.html	Album: You Could Have It So Much Better	"Words fall from my mouth
Like plates from shaking hands
Smash upon the silence
Of the smooth naked canal
I'm evil and a heathen
I'm evil and a heathen
I'm a heathen and evil like you
There's not a lot
Not a lot I couldn't do
I like how you pretend
That the end will be the end
So fill your thirst
Drink a curse
To the death of death instead
I'm evil and a heathen
I'm evil and a heathen
I'm a heathen and evil like you
There's not a lot
Not a lot I wouldn't do
Utrecht led me to the Sacre Coeur
Where the smoke curled round
Now the ice blows of Lake Michigan
When the ice blows
The ice flows knocks you down
Your teeth are black with wine
As you place those lips on mine
And the moon hangs heavy and forbidden high
On the **** night of our lives
I'm evil and a heathen
I'm evil and a heathen
I'm a heathen and evil like you
There's not a lot
Not a lot we couldn't do"
Fabulously Lazy	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/fabulously_lazy-lyrics-522657.html	-	"I've hardly seen her likes before
Somewhere else
Nowhere else before
The girl in the spotlight evermore
Like no one before
Forever more
Bloody Marys, two for tea
Bubble bath and TV
All the boys from rock and roll
Sometimes she likes soul
No one sees her lift a finger
What a singer
What a dancer
What a sinner
Fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy
All my work, for what it's worth
Won't do me none
Can make you feel so right
All those wins are a loss
Can't be a winner
If she's never lost
Her success is divine
What a word for mine
Daytime is a tragedy
But now it smells like victory
Who does she think she is?
What a singer
What a dancer
What a sinner
She leaves the world in envy
All is now, no maybe
No one's left untouched
She's so fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy
Fabulously lazy"
Fade Together	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/fade_together-lyrics-433948.html	Album: You Could Have It So Much Better	"So far away
Come on I'll take you far away
Let's get away
Come on let's make a getaway
Once you have loved someone this much
You doubt it could fade
Despite how much you'd like it to
God how you'd like it, you'd like it to fade
Let's fade together
Let's fade forever
Let's fade together
Let's fade forever
Let's fade together
If we get away
You know we might just stay away
So stay awake
Oh why the hell should I stay awake
When you're far away
Oh God you are so far away
I looked at your ... (?)
I look like I just jumped the Berlin Wall
Darling I love you, I'm starting to fade

Get Away	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/get_away-lyrics-522656.html	-	"Get away from me
You don't have to stay so long at all
Get away from me
You keep crying your make-up off on me
Get away from me
Your skin and bone, believe me, leave me
Get away from me
She doesn't stumble, she falls right off her feet
La-la-la...
You think I'm a doll
When you scribble on my face
You try to poke my eyes out
Pursued as a god
Hard to replace
As you cry your evil eyes out
You twist your pretty face
As you cry your evil eyes out
You cry, yes, you cry
As you cry your evil eyes out
Get away from me
I can't feel her loose hand on my face
Get away from me
I been at it since I don't know when, I say
Get away from me
To be, how to lose it ... (?)
Get away from me
I see your red hue
Get away from me"

I'm Your Villain	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/im_your_villain-lyrics-433950.html	Album: You Could Have It So Much Better	"You toss in a word
I'm your villain
I see the passion emerged
I'm your villain
But serious
You're so serious
Like a waiter
Hating the rich
But taking their tips
If I could laugh, I'd love you
If I could smile at anything you said
We could be laughing lovers
I think you prefer to be miserable instead
If I could love, I'd love you
If I could love like anybody else
I know what I am
I'm your villain
I don't give a damn
I'm your villain
Because serious
You're so serious
But I got ready salted
Ready on your belly
If you wanna have fun
See you later"
Jacqueline	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/jacqueline-lyrics-219234.html	Album: Franz Ferdinand	"Jacqueline was seventeen
working on a desk
when Ivor
Peered above a spectacle
forgot that he had wrecked a girl
Sometimes these eyes
Forget the face they're peering from
When the face they peer upon
Well, you know
That face as I do
And how in the return of the gaze
She can return you the face
That you are staring from
CHORUS:
It's always better on holiday
So much better on holiday
That's why we only work when
We need the money
REPEAT CHORUS
Gregor was down again
Said come on, kick me again
Said, I'm so drunk
I don't mind if you kill me
Come on you gutless
I'm alive
I'm alive
I'm alive
and how I know it
But for chips and for freedom
I could die

He died of the lance of silver
We stopped the time for Jeremy Fraser
He died of the lance of silver
Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There’s no reason to know
Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There’s no reason to know
We stopped the time for Jeremy Fraser
He died of the lance of silver
In the middle of the trees, oh, we taught him
How to freeze, freeze, freeze when it came to watson
Dragged from the woods and
Dumped in the middle of our old school yard
He was dragged from the woods and
Dumped in the middle of our old school yard
Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There’s no reason to know
Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There’s no reason to know
Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There’s no reason to know
Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There’s no reason to know
Working hard on his appearance
What can you do when you’re left with a debt
And your bleeding heart
Is dead?
Grow older, he’s dead to you
We stopped for the life of Jeremy Fraser
Some stopped for the life of Jeremy Fraser
Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There’s no reason to know
Do you want to know how we stopped the time?
There’s no reason to know
We stopped the time for Jeremy Fraser
He died of the lance of silver
We stopped the time for Jeremy Fraser
He died of the lance of silver"

How I wish that I could feel so good
I wish that I could be as good as you
Well, Lynsey Wells
How I wish that I could feel the good
Beyond the poison in us like you do
LP records in your little hands
Put them on your little dansette for a dance
All those men sing you'll never walk alone
But you'll never let them break your little heart.
Well, Lynsey Wells
How I wish that I could feel so good
I wish that I could be as good as you
Well, Lynsey Wells
How I wish that I could feel the good
Beyond the poison in us like you do
If you have some sort of secret
If you need someone to tell
You can tell me
Because my memory
Always fails
I will forget
And your secret
Will remain
Yes the secret
The secret
Will remain
Well, Lynsey Wells

Because the greatest love
Is always ruined by the bickering
The argument of living
So I want to live alone
I could be happy on my own
Live the rest of my life
With the vaguest of feeling
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
Wishing I could be there
So I'm going to live alone
I'm not saying that out love is the greatest
But I'm in love with you
Want to stay in love with you
So I'm going to live alone
Yeah I'll be happy on my own
Live the rest of my life
With the vaguest of feeling
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
Wishing I could be there
In NYC when
I get in a taxi
I say ""man"" to the driver so
He'll think
""Man!
I can imagine
Having a drink with that guy""
""He's alright""
Wherever you are
Whoever is there
You know that I'll be here
Wishing I could be there"

I have to learn how to live or I'll die

You tak your white finger
Slide the nail under
The top and bottom buttons of
My blazer
Relax the fraying wool
Slacken ties at you in the shoe
But the eyes
Fight the eyes

Find me and follow me
Through corridors, refectories
And files you must follow leave
This academic factory
You will find me in the matinee
The dark of the matinee
It's better in the matinee
The dark of the matinee is mine
Yes it's mine
Verse 2:
I time every journey
To bump into you
Accidentally I
Charm you and tell you
Of the boys I hate
All the girls I hate
All the words I hate
All the clothes I hate
How I'll never be anything I hate
You smile, mention something that you like
Oh, how you'd have a happy life
If you did the things you like
Chorus:
Find me and follow me
Through corridors, refectories
And files you must follow leave
This academic factory
You will find me in the matinee
The dark of the matinee
It's better in the matinee
The dark of the matinee is mine
Yes it's mine
Verse 3:
So I'm on BBC2 now
Tellin' Terry Wogan how
I made it and
What I made is unclear now
But his differences and his laughter is
My words and smile are so easy now
Yes it's easy now
Yes it's easy now

Find me and follow me
Through corridors, refectories
And files you must follow leave
This academic factory
You will find me in the matinee

Missing You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/missing_you-lyrics-453825.html	Album: Unreleased	"Some miserable day, back in November
Newcastle is grey, as grey as the river
But your eyes are bright with life
And life is bright with you
I'm missing you
You're laughing again, I'm so glad that she met you
As you start to explain something, I'm proud of you
But I forget all that, relax
And just enjoy the fact that life is good
I'm missing you
So I'm trying to pretend you're out in the garden
That you're about to walk in
To wash your hands in the kitchen
But she said your face changed
And your breath got slower and slower
Until there was breath no more"

Curse the grime and curse the stains on the air

You're the bath now running old
I can feel the wall between us separate the filthy scene
As I push the door aside - swallow, swallow, swallow, smile
I wander round the gulf between us
Wonder how I came to feel as fragile as a broken bone
As useless - I'm a broken bone
Come on let's fight let's feel alive
Come on let's fight let's feel alive
It's the only feeling I've kept towards you
That resembles any passion, any tremble, any word,
I'll take and turn it, twist and pissed-on, I'll return it
Give me more, give me, I'll swallow, swallow, swallow, smile
But it's alright, I lie
It's alright, here's another lie"
Take Me Out	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/take_me_out-lyrics-66899.html	Album: Franz Ferdinand	"So if you're lonely
You know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a cross-hair
I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here
You leave me broken, shattered I lie
I'm just a cross-hair
I'm just a shot, then we can die
I know I won't be leaving here with you
I say don't you know
You say you don't know
I say... take me out
I stay, you don't show
Don't move, time is slow
I say... take me out
I say don't you know
You say you don't know
I say... take me out
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
I want you... to take me out
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you
I say don't you know
You say you don't know
I say... take me out
If I wait, this could die
If I wane, this could die
I want you... to take me out
If I move, this could die
If eyes move, this could die
Come on... take me out
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here (with you)
I know I won't be leaving here with you"
Tell Her Tonight	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/tell_her_tonight-lyrics-422596.html	Album: Franz Ferdinand	"I only watched her walk, but she saw it
I only heard her talk, but she saw it
I only touched her lips but she saw it
I only kissed her lips, but she saw it
Gonna have to tell her tonight (x4)
She only flicked her eyes, but I saw it
She only swung her hair, but I saw it
She only shook her hips, but I saw it
She only licked her lips, but I saw it
Gonna have to tell her tonight (x4)
Hey, I'll have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah
I'll have to tell her, tell her tonight, yeah
I'll have to tell her, to tell her tonight, yeah
I'll have to tell her, to tell her tonight
I only held her hand, but she saw it
I only watched her walk, but she saw it
I only touched her neck but she saw it
I only kissed her lips, but she saw it
Gonna have to tell her tonight (x4)
Hey, I'll have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah
Hey, I'll have to tell her, you tell her tonight, yeah
You have to tell her, you tell her tonight, oh yeah!"
The Fallen	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/the_fallen-lyrics-433959.html	Album: You Could Have It So Much Better	"Some say you're trouble, boy
Just because you like to destroy
All the things that bring the idiots joy
Well, what's wrong with a little destruction?
And the Kunst won't talk to you
Because you kissed St Rollox Adieu
Because you robbed a supermarket or two
Well, who gives a damn about the prophets of Tesco?
Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
Turn the rich into wine
Walk on the mean
For the fallen walk among us
Walk among us
Never judge us
Yeah we're all...
Up now and get 'em, boy
Up now and get 'em, boy
Drink to the devil and death at the doctors
Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
Five thousand users fed today
As you feed us
Won't you lead us
To be blessed
So we stole and drank Champagne
On the seventh seal you said you never feel pain
""I never feel pain, won't you hit me again?""
""I need a bit of black and blue to be a rotation""
In my blood I feel the bubbles burst
There was a flash of fist, an eyebrow burst
You've a lazy laugh and a red white shirt
I fell to the floor fainting at the sight of blood
Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
Turn the rich into wine
Walk on the mean
Be they Magdalene or virgin you've already been
You've already been and we've already seen
That the fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us
Never judge us to be blessed
So I'm sorry if I ever resisted
I never had a doubt you ever existed
I only have a problem when people insist on
Taking their hate and placing it on your name
Some say you're trouble, boy
Just because you like to destroy
You are the word, the word is 'destroy'
I break this bottle and think of you fondly
Did I see you in a limousine
Flinging out the fish and the unleavened
To the whore in a hostel
Or the scum of a scheme
Turn the rich into wine
Walk on the mean
It's not a jag in the arm
It's a nail in the beam
On this barren Earth
You scatter your seed
Be they Magdalene or virgin
You've already been
Yeah, you've already been
We've already seen
That the fallen are the virtuous among us
Walk among us
If you judge us
We're all damned"
The Outsiders	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/the_outsiders-lyrics-433947.html	Album: You Could Have It So Much Better	"We've seen some change
But we're still outsiders
If everybody's here
Then hell knows
We ride alone
I've seen some years
But you're still my Caesar
With everything I feel
I feel you've already been here
The only difference is all I see is now all that I've seen
It's bright on the outside
The bright love the dark side
I know it's obvious
But sometimes
You just have to say it
So you don't feel so weak
About being such a freak
Or alone
In seventeen years
Will you still be Camille
Lee Miller, Gala or whatever
You know what I mean, yeah
Love'll die
Lovers fade
But you still remain there
Squeezing in your fingers
What it means for me to be yeah
The only difference is what might be is now what might have been
When you saw me sleeping
You thought I was dreaming of you
I didn't tell you
That the only dream
Is Valium for me
The only difference is that
I've seen some years
But you're still my Caesar
With everything I feel
I feel you've already been here
Love'll die
Lovers fade
But you still remain there
Squeezing in your fingers
What it means for me to be yeah
The only difference is what might be is now."
This Boy	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/this_boy-lyrics-433957.html	Album: You Could Have It So Much Better	"It seems this boy's bathed in ridicule
Too forward, way too physical
It's time that I had another
I'm always wanting more, if there's another one
Give me some more, I'll have another one
I'll have a slice of your mother
This boy's quite spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car
I want a car
I sees losers losing everywhere
If I lose it'll only the damn I give for another
I am complete, invincible
If I have one set principle
Then it's to stand on you, brother
This boy is so spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car
I want a car
If I like cocaine, I'm racing you
For organic fresh Echinacea
One kick's as good as another
If I'm tired, I'm tired of telling you
I'm never tired, I'm always better than you
Bye-bye boy, run to your mother
This boy is so spectacular
Not a boy, but a wealthy bachelor
I want a car
I want a car"
This Fire	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/this_fire-lyrics-219235.html	Album: Franz Ferdinand	"Eyes
Boring a way through me
Paralyse
Controlling completely
Now
There is a fire in me
Fire that burns
Fire that burns
This fire is out of control
I'm going to burn this city
Burn this city
If this fire is out of control
Then I
I'm out of control and I burn
Eyes
Burning a way to me
Overwhelm
Destroying so sweetly
Now
There is a fire in me
Fire that burns
Fire that burns
This fire..."
Van Tango	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/van_tango-lyrics-468827.html	Album: Franz Ferdinand	"Van Tango had a mean old scene, Van Tango!
(Mean old scene, Van Tango)
Van Tango had a mean old scene, Van Tango!
(Mean old scene, Van Tango)
He worked night-shift at the opera
(Mean old scene, Van Tango)
Watching the girls go by
(Girls go by, Van Tango)
He's singled out tonight
(Singled out, Van Tango)
He's singled out every night
(Singled out, Van Tango)
Caretaker of the night
He's the king of the night
Caretaker of the night
He's the king of the night
Van Tango had a mean old scene, Van Tango!
(Mean old scene, Van Tango)
Van Tango had a mean old scene, Van Tango!
(Mean old scene, Van Tango)
He wore his quiff Venetian style
(Venetian style, Van Tango)
His fags were cheap, but with a filter
(Really cheap, Van Tango)
He don't suck up to no-one tonight
(Don't suck up, Van Tango)
He don't suck up to no-one at all
(Don't suck up, Van Tango)
Van Tango, Van Tango
Van Tango, Van Tan-Tan-Tan-Tan-Tango
Caretaker of the night
He's the king of the night
Caretaker of the night

Walk Away	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/walk_away-lyrics-433956.html	Album: You Could Have It So Much Better	"I swapped my innocence for pride
Crushed the end within my stride
Said 'I'm strong now I know that I'm a leaver""
I love the sound of you walking away
Mascara bleeds a blackened tear
And I am cold
Yes I'm cold
But not as cold as you are
I love the sound of you walking away
Why don't you walk away?
No buildings will fall down
Why don't you walk away?
No quake will split the ground
Why don't you walk away?
The sun won't swallow the sky
Why don't you walk away?
Statues will not cry
I cannot turn to see those eyes
As apologies may rise
I must be strong and stay an unbeliever
And love the sound of you walking away
Mascara bleeds into my eye
I'm not cold
I am old
At least as old as you are
As you walk away
And as you walk away
My headstone crumbles down
As you walk away
The Hollywood wind's a howl
As you walk away
The Kremlin's falling
As you walk away
Radio 4 is static
As you walk away
The stab of stiletto
On a silent night
Stalin smiles
Hitler laughs
Churchill claps
Mao Tse-Tung
On the back"
Well That Was Easy	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/well_that_was_easy-lyrics-433952.html	Album: You Could Have It So Much Better	"Well that was easy waiting
Everything's easy now
And the days are oh so normal
But oh, Hannah
How I miss you
Now
I used to lock myself in your bathroom
Swallowing the Codeine kept for your back
Numb, so numb
I'd let your words
Come and come
So come on -
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
Because I'm leaving you now
That was easy, but how I miss you
That was easy, but I still miss you
That was easy, but how I miss you now
I watched you clean the filth off your phone dial
Swallowing the things your finger picked up
Tongue, your tongue
I'd watch your tongue licking on
Eeuuw
So come
Come on tongue
Ah, come on tongue
Kill me now
Kill me now
Kill me now
As I'm leaving you now
That was easy, but how I miss you"
What You Meant	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/what_you_meant-lyrics-433951.html	Album: You Could Have It So Much Better	"As I took a step number four
Into the close of your tenement
You cast your darkened eyes so low
Said we're cold as the step cement
But I just don't know what you meant
So Alec you may want a pill
We are so cruel to communicate
Without the red stuff being spilled
We must MDMA our sentiment
But I just don't know what you meant
If we were feckless we'd be fine
Sucking hard on our innocence
But we've been bright in our decline
Been left as blackened filament
But I just don't know what you meant
'Cause I feel blood inside the vein
I feel life inside the ligament
I feel alive yeah just the same
Same vigour and the same intent
So I just don't know if that's what you meant"
Words So Leisured	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/words_so_leisured-lyrics-468826.html	Album: Unreleased	"She's an emotion avenger
She is the villain who sells
A line of dark fantastic passion
She knows that you will surrender
Knows that you will surrender
You want this fantastic passion
We'll have fantastic passion
You can feel her lips undress your eyes
Wash that ugly skin and never feel good
Never feel your fingers tingle tense anticipation on it
This was an easy one
Feel the word and melt upon it
Words of love
Words so leisured
Words are poisoned darts of pleasure
Tied
Yes, she's in her black mood tonight
Watch her dye your black hair white
Rob you of you muscle slacken
All the skin that was so tight
So ask for reason
Ask for any reason
Ask for the one reply
For the one reply
Try for reason
But passion never lives it dies
It's reason
Try for reason
Then die"

Said I looked truly down
That I oughtta come over
And talk about it
Well I wasn't down
I just wasn't smiling at you
As I look at us now it seems
That your slapping my back
As if it's all alright
But it's not
I tried to get up
But you're pushing me down
Yeah you're pushing me down
So I'll get up on my own
Now there's some grinning goon
On my TV screen
Telling us all that
It's alright because
She wears this
And he wears that
If you get some of these
It'll all be alright
Yeah if you get some of these
It'll all be alright'
Well I refuse
To be a cynical goon
Passing the masses
An easy answer
Because it won't be alright
Oh no it won't be alright
It won't be alright
Unless you get up
Come on and get up
Well, I'm just a voice in your earpiece
Telling you no
Its not alright
You know you could have it so much better
You could have it so much better
If you tried"
You're The Reason I'm Leaving	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/youre_the_reason_im_leaving-lyrics-433954.html	Album: You Could Have It So Much Better	"Some granite wall
Numbs our bones, numbs our all
As we sit on skinny hands
Nothing to say, nothing at all
I don't know you and I... I don't want to
You're so awkward just like me
But I don't care
You're the reason I'm leaving
You're the reason I'm leaving
If I leave then we don't stop leaving alone
I'd no idea that in four years
I'd be hanging from a beam
behind the door of number ten
Singing well fare thee well
fare thee well
fare thee well
I am leaving
Yes I leave it all to you
You're the reason I'm leaving (I'm leaving alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (I'm leaving alone)
If I leave then we don't stop leaving alone
You're the reason I'm leaving (I'm leaving alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (I'm leaving alone)
If I leave then we don't stop leaving alone
As we ride along under an optimistic sun
The radio sings that Everybody song by REM
And Here I Am Fighting Fighting
Yes I'm Fighting not to cry
And that's another reason
Why I oughtta hate you like I do
Like I do
oh Like I do.
You're the reason I'm leaving (I'm leaving alone)
You're the reason I'm leaving (I'm leaving alone)
If I leave then we don't stop leaving alone
I'm the reason you're leaving (I'm leaving alone)
I'm the reason we're leaving (I'm leaving alone)

Your Diary	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/franz_ferdinand/your_diary-lyrics-520031.html	Album: Do You Want To Pt1	"Suddenly you will believe me
What more was it that I could be
[is you believe in me]
The year two-thousand
I'll be back on the dole
Single but free
The best we'll ever be
[your love...]
Oh I'm alone in your room
There on the floor, there's a little black book
You left it there on the floor
You left it and I opened it
Your diary
It's open and inviting me back
Why you loved him
He's asking you why you loved him
He's asking you why you loved him
But you couldn't say why you loved him
Ohhh
But he gave you a list
Of all the reasons why he did
And you couldn't reply
But you could say that you did
Your diary
It's open and inviting me back
His lips like petals
Unfurling from a bud
I could have ripped page and petals
Ripped to the blood
But I didn't and don't
Want you ever to read
Any diary of mine
And word I may leave
Your diary
It's open and inviting me back"
