Abraham, Martin, And John	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/abraham_martin_and_john-lyrics-1145780.html	-	"Anybody here seen my old friend Abraham?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed lotta people but it seems the good they die young
You know I just looked around and he's gone
Anybody here seen my old friend John?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed lotta people but it seems the good they die young
I just looked around and he's gone
Anybody here seen my old friend Martin?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
He freed lotta people but it seems the good they die young
I just looked around and he's gone
Didn't you love the things that they stood for?
Didn't they try to find some good for you and me?
And we'll be free
Some day  soon, it's gonna be one day
Anybody here seen my old friend Bobby?
Can you tell me where he's gone?
I thought I saw him walkin' up over the hill
With Abraham, Martin, and John"
All The Fools Sailed Away	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/all_the_fools_sailed_away-lyrics-68301.html	Album: Dream Evil	"En høyreist ridder vender hjem
Over himmel til himmel på en selvgjort bro
Fra den endelige tvekamp mot lysets prest
For nå til sist å gå til ro
Se der i fjellbrisens indre
Hvor dets liv har søkt ly for en sol
Som omsider vil mørkne med den evige natt
Og hindre en verden i (å) blomstre og gro
Se der i øyets satire
Hvor rester av godhet jages på flukt
Og vindes vekk i en åpen grav
Til den siste tenning av lys er slukket
Med kraftige hugg i menneske skaller
Frydes den rytter i årvåken dis
Himmelhøyt, vandrende over sin stjerne
Skottende på en jord dekket i is
Over utallige faldne menn
Som sådde livets spirende korn
Streifer han vekk fra den siste krig
Den mektigste fyrste, den blodige torn"
Along Comes A Spider	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/along_comes_a_spider-lyrics-68351.html	Album: Killing The Dragon	"Remember when you only needed no one
Every day's tomorrow
And it's all right
No confessions - not for you
Forget the things you've done
It's what you'll do
The first time you're suspicious
What's that gliding down
Along comes a spider
Suddenly the world has no more changes
You've run with an evil woman
So it's all right
No more strangers? candy lies
The light is so much better for your eyes
Now I'm not superstitious
But every time you've tried
Along comes a spider
Don't ask why - it's the long way around
Just go wild
Why do we believe in conversation
We never seem to listen
We only hear
Now you don't need permission
But don't get caught next time
Along comes a spider
A spider
A spider
Inside her"
Another Lie	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/another_lie-lyrics-68288.html	Album: Sacred Heart	"There's perfect harmony
In the rising and the falling of the sea
And as we sail along
I never fail to be astounded by
The things we'll do for promises
And a song
We are the innocent
We are the damned
We were caught in the middle of the madness
Hunted by the lion and the lamb
We bring you fantasy
We bring you pain
It's your one great chance for a miracle
Or we will disappear
Never to be seen again
And all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
Sailed away
We bring you beautiful
We teach you sin
We can give you a piece of the universe
Or we will disappear
Never to return again
And all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
Sailed away
Sailed away
And as we drift along
I never fail to be astounded by
The things we'll do for promises
And a song
We are the innocent
We cut we bleed
We're your one great chance for a miracle
And a miracle is something you need
They'll take your diamonds
And give you steel
you'll be caught in middle of the madness
Lost like them
And a part of all the pain that they feel
And all the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
All the fools sailed away
Leaving nothing to say
All the fools sailed away
They say you're beautiful
And they'll always let you in
But doors are never open
To a child without a trace of sin
Sail, sail, sail"
As Long As It's Not About Love	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/as_long_as_its_not_about_love-lyrics-68356.html	Album: Magica	"From the first time we touched with our eyes
Only magic could take away my heart
I am always afraid for my heart
So lay beside me now and tell me lies - sweet lies
As long as it's not about love
Shall we sail off the edge of the world
Fall forever and never look behind
But I must keep my heart from my mind
Lay beside me now and tell me lies
As long as it's not about love
Oh the last time we touched with our eyes
And the magic was stronger than the heart
Oh, I can't run away with my heart
So, lay beside me now and tell me lies
As long as it's not about love
Shall we sail off the edge of the world
Fall forever
Take my heart away but no
You can't say words about love
Ooh
If the magic comes between us
And we never meet again
Take a part of me away
'Cause maybe it's all above love
Love, ooh"
Before The Fall	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/before_the_fall-lyrics-68366.html	Album: Killing The Dragon	"Someone had a dream
Never been to London
Never in a limousine
Something made him go
Could it be the voices
Coming from the radio
But somewhere down the line
The happiness you'll find
Will crash into a wall
Just before the fall
Someone joined the band
But he never heard the music
Couldn't really understand
No, no no
Don't know what they mean
Where's my picture
Shining from a magazine
But somewhere down the line
He'll quickly glance behind
Then smash into a wall
Before the fall
Someone ran so fast
When he saw the future
He was sure that it was just the past
Someone had a dream
Only this one ended lost
Inside the old machine
And somewhere down the line
They'll say that his is mine
And all that's left is time
Time to fall and stumble, ah"
Better In The Dark	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/better_in_the_dark-lyrics-68352.html	Album: Killing The Dragon	"I'm all right - I'm crossing over
I just shot the sun
One more night - black as heaven
So no-one saw the gun
Running with monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Oh, she's all right - tall and handsome
If the lights are down
Gone by dawn - takes no chances
Might come back around
Clutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
I'm all right - I'm crossing over
I can disappear - gone
Clutching to monsters in shadows
And monsters always know
It's better in the dark
Better in the dark
I just shot the sun"
Between Two Hearts	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/between_two_hearts-lyrics-68316.html	Album: Lock Up The Wolves	"She's a rumor in the night
It's crazy
You can see her but she isn't there
She's the stealer of the light
It's crazy
But you go anywhere
It was just a summer night
Maybe
When a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away
Maybe
To go where-where-where
She crouches the hunter
Ready to tell you
Another lie
Another lie
You could see the side of someday
Feel the power of the young and strong
You were learning how to fly someway
You were wrong-wrong-wrong
She jumped at the moment
A chance to tell you
Another lie
It was just a summer night
Maybe
When a shiver cut across the air
Should you run and get away
Maybe
To go where-where-where
She jumps at the moment
She crouches the hunter yeah
You look and you know she's telling you
Another lie
Another lie
Why it's crazy
When you feel you're getting stronger
Why it's crazy
All the lies are getting longer
Another lie
Another lie"
Big Sister	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/big_sister-lyrics-68329.html	Album: Angry Machines	"She never breaks into the conversation
He seems to be the reason why she lives
She tries to be the perfect kind of stranger
But we always seem to love the most
The ones who never give
Chorus:
It's between two hearts
A personal situation
It's between two hearts
The kind of love with a bad reputation
We never have to ask her why she's crying
The simile she had's been kicked into a frown
But still ti makes her day to be his pleasure
Should we open up her eyes
Can we ever break the spell
Chorus:
It's between two hearts
A personal combination
It's between two hearts
The kind of love with a bad reputation
Put on your party face and come along
Join in the big parade
Here comes the camera
Do you look as good as your sister
Smile at the animals
They should be the ones in the cages
Turn the page
Another way to spend a rainy Sunday
Waiting for a call that never comes
The mystery is how she makes her choices
But don't we always choose
The ones who hide the sun
Chorus:
It's between two hearts
Love and desperation
It's between two hearts
The kind of love
Between two hearts
A personal situation
It's between two hearts
The kind of love with a reputation"
Black	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/black-lyrics-68327.html	Album: Angry Machines	"Who controls your mind
There have been changes
No more giving it all for free
There will be changes
Now woman is all you need
A-ah
Here is a number
You've been given an another name
We will be watching
One might fall but you'll all be blamed
Shame, shame
Here's big sister
We're big sister
Hear big sister
There's big sister
Dancing on your grave
Who controls your mind
Who's in charge of hearts
Who controls you time
We're in charge of you
There have been changes
Even mother's a soldier now
There have been changes
You can touch 'cause you don't know how
No
Here's big sister
We're big sister
Hear big sister
There's big sister
Dancing on your grave
Pretty faces, young and clean
Watching you from magazines
All they want is something more
Kill the king and then we'll crown the whore
Here's big sister
We're big sister
Hear big sister
There's big sister
Who controls your mind
In charge of hearts
Controls your time
In charge of you
Here's big sister
We're big sister
Control"
Blood From A Stone	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/blood_from_a_stone-lyrics-68328.html	Album: Strange Highways	"Identify the real world
Investigate the real world
Intensify inspection
There for all to see
Here's what lies do
All things turn to
Black, black
Yeah, no
Now desensitize your heartbeat
Regulate the heartbeat
Sterilize all emotion
Justify your needs
Here's what love does
Dies and fades to
Black, black
There are no champions
Who saves the lonely ones
In the corner
Black, yeah
Black
You must identify
You and the real world
Interrogate the new real world
Then generate intention
Information, please
Here's what i know
Soon we'll all go
We must fade to

Born On The Sun	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/born_on_the_sun-lyrics-68309.html	Album: Lock Up The Wolves	"Oh, you've been surprised again
Pulled like a leaf to the waterfall
Everybody's just pretending
I thought that you'd learn by now
Ooh, think about it one more time
What have you got when the god is gone
Clouds don't have a silver lining
And all you ever get is rain
'Cause you can't get blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
You can't get blood from a stone
It isn't once upon a time
When nobody falls and the hero flies
That victims got to fit the crime
And nobody goes down with you
You, you!
'Cause you can't get blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
You can't get blood from a stone
No, no
'Cause you can't get blood from a stone
You can't open the door if there's nobody home
They've taken it all so just leave me alone
No, you can't get blood from a stone
No blood from a stone
Go on and leave me alone
And I know it's a shock
To learn that you can't
You can't, you can't get blood from a rock"
Breathless	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/breathless-lyrics-68281.html	Album: The Last In Line	"There's a crack in the rainbow
There's a hole in the sky
You believed in something
Now it's just a lie
No jokes from the jester
Not a laugh from the clown
And your world is upside down
You can hide in a circle
It's a way to survive
be another number
At least you'd be alive
Or you can ride with the gypsy
He can take you to hell
And the answers sceaming
In a voice you know so well
Chorus:
You - you're made of fire
Never higher
You were made to run
You - you're burning higher
You've got the fire
You were born on the sun
So take a walk with the wild one
It's the way that I've found
You can turn it upside down
Chorus"
Bring Down The Rain	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/bring_down_the_rain-lyrics-68332.html	Album: Strange Highways	"You said a single word
But no one really heard
Sometimes we scream alone
It's always worse at night
When darkness kills the light
We're in the danger zone
You wait with pounding heart
You know it's just the start
Cause you're Breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, willing to learn
Breathless, the circle still turns
You're Breathless
Living inside your mind
Who knows the things you'll find
There could be hell or rainbows
But it's a funny thing
The more you feel the sting
You're just a leaf that the wind blows
You've been this way before
One step and you're through the door
And you're Breathless, ready to burn
Breathless, the circle still turns
Breathless, willing to learn
You're Breathless
Repeat Verse 1"
Caught In The Middle	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/caught_in_the_middle-lyrics-68274.html	Album: Holy Diver	"Did you ever believe in your dreams before
Were you always afraid of the dark
Is the edge of the world always in your head
Does the gun point straight at your heart
It used to come just when you sleep
But now, it's only a shout away
You always seem to find the sun
But this time, the sun is a fire
Bring down the rain
This house is burning again
Put out the flame
Bring down the rain
You were told that the storm would just roll on by
That the thunder was made in your mind
And the heat in the night was to keep you warm
And the truth could be told by a lier now
You always seem to find the light
But this time, the light is a fire
Bring down the rain
This house is burning again
Put down the flame
Bring down the rain
Shake up, break up, everybody make up
Everything's always the same
Trapped down, trapped down, everybody back down
Bring down the rain
You always seem to find the light
But this time, the light is a fire
Bring down the rain
This house is burning again
Don't play the game
Bring down the rain
Put out the flame
Bring down the rain
It's the shake up, break up, everybody make up
Well, it's always the same
Trapped down, cracked down, everybody back down
Won't you bring down all the rain"
Challis (Marry The Devil's Daughter)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/challis_marry_the_devils_daughter-lyrics-68353.html	Album: Magica	"I am a rock
And you are glass
Never broken - never last
And if you're in my way I'll knock you down
If it's a joke
I'll never laugh
Here's exactly how I see you in the light
You're like a tear in the ocean
Dust in the wind
Like a stone in the water
I'm gonna sleep with the devil's daughter
I am your shock
I am your shame
Another face without a name
And if you think I'm angry just come over
I need to tell
Just who you are
My description of the world I've seen so far
You're like a tear in the ocean
Dust in the wind
Like a stone in the water
I might marry the devil's daughter
I am a rock
And you are glass
If it's a joke
Nobody laugh
And even - When you know you're guilty still you're right
You're like a tear in the ocean
Dust in the wind
Like a stone in the water
Like a spark in the fire
Dust in the sand
Like a stone in the water
I'm gonna run with the devil's daughter
Run, run, run, run, run away!
Require, explanation. What is love?
Who is love? When is love? Where is love? Why is love?"
Cold Feet	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/cold_feet-lyrics-68364.html	Album: Killing The Dragon	"Tired of living in the black and white?
Where fools can tell you that you're never right
I know a place where the film's in color
Just step inside of yourself
Here's a place in the front row
So on with the show
The same old shadow on the run
That's no shadow, it's your shadow's son
I know a place where the pools got water
And you don't need to know how to swim
Here's the key to the back door
Do you want more
Do you need more?
Same old rhythm to the same old rhyme
The same old clock - same old time
There's a place where the grass is greener
And you can shake, rattle and roll
Here's the key to the front door
Do you want more
Will you need more?
Tired of living in the black and white
Where no-one's wrong and you're never right
Same old steps to the same old dance
Just one more reason - one more chance
Oh"
Death By Love	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/death_by_love-lyrics-784457.html	Album: Master Of The Moon	"One night when the stars were right for the gypsy queen
And she found she could drag you down
To a place that's in-between it all
She's a madman with a delicate hand and evil eyes
And I've heard she'll only say a word
And that's enough to satisfy
Don't ask why, don't even think about it
Brave men die but what a way to go
She's not above
Death by love
One spell from the wishing well
And you're never more
A bad start for the sacred heart
'Cause the end has come before the beginning
Knee deep in the darkest sleep But the eyes see all
So high you could break the sky And never feel the fall to come
Strong men die but what a way to go
She's not above
Death by love
Don't ask why
Don't even think about it
Brave men die but what a way to go
You've got symptoms of
Death by love
She's not above
Death by love
Don't ask why
Don't even guess about it
All men die but this is death by love"
Don't Talk To Strangers	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/dont_talk_to_strangers-lyrics-68278.html	Album: Holy Diver	"Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river in you flow
You can sail away to the sun
And let it burn you while you can
Or walk a long bloody road
Like the hero who never ran
You'll feel it
You'll feel it
You'll feel the rush of it all
Flying away int the clouds
You know you're loosing your control
Finding you way in the dark
Like some poor forgotten soul
You'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of the city lights
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again
Looking inside of yourself
You might see someone you don't know
Maybe it's just what you need
Letting the river I know that's in you flow
You'll feel it
You'll see it
You'll feel the rush of thunder
You'll feel it
I see it in your eyes, you're
Caught in the middle
Just like the way you've always been
Caught in the middle
Helpless again"
Don't Tell The Kids	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/dont_tell_the_kids-lyrics-68326.html	Album: Angry Machines	"Don't talk to strangers
Cause they're only there to do you harm
Don't write in starlight
Cause the words may come out real
Don't hide in doorways
You may find the key that opens up your soul
Don't go to Heaven cause it's really only Hell
Don't smell the flowers
They're an evil drug to make you loose your mind
Don't dream of women cause they only bring you down
Hey you you know me you've touched I'm real
I'm forever the one that lets you look and see and
Feel me I'm danger - I'm the stranger
I I'm darkness I'm anger I'm pain
I am master
The evil song you sing inside your brain
Make you inside
Don't dance in darkness
You may stumble and you're sure to fall
Don't write in starlight
Cause the words may come out real
Don't talk to strangers
Cause they're only there to make you sad
Don't dream of women
Cause they'll only bring you down"
Double Monday	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/double_monday-lyrics-68336.html	Album: Angry Machines	"Please, please, make love freeze
And break apart in the middle of it
Then they could see the hate
When they separate
And taste the salt of their tears
No, no, it's all about experience
Control, you might as well be wood, no good
Why why, your questions die
In a shout and no attention
You might have said
That they both were dead
So put the puzzle away
But no, it's all about experience
Control, they're gonna give you none, no fun
Don't tell the kids, they'll never understand it
Don't tell the kids, don't waste your time, no
Get back, it's a heart attack
And the planet needs a doctor
We can tell it looks like hell
But they make us close our eyes
No, it's all about experience
And control, you might as well be stone, alone
Don't tell the kids, they'll never understand it
Don't tell the kids, don't waste your time, yeah
Don't tell the kids, they'll never get the picture
Don't tell the kids, you waste your time, yeah
Don't tell the kids, they just don't understand it
Don't tell the kids, don't waste your time, time
Talk to the animals
Anyone who'll answer
Any fool will do
Just don't tell the kids"

Each time you think that you've just begun
It's the end

Sounds like double Monday
Yeah
Feels like snakes and spiders
Crawling up your body
Every someday double Monday

Just when you think you've seen it all you
You lose your special place to hide
So get ready for the ride, ride, ride
Yeah
Every someday double Monday"

Somewhere on the morning road
Just waiting for you
Somethings that just could never be

Dream evil
The dark that you find in the back of your mind
Dream evil - Dream evil
Don't go to the edge of rainbows
Don't close your eyes
Like things that can't be real
The truth is really lies
Don't wish on a rising star you should
Open up the door
Where things that just should never be

Dream evil
The dark that you find
Can come out of your mind
Dream evil
Take you away
Oh no it's the midnight hour
Don't leave me alone

Eat Your Heart Out	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/eat_your_heart_out-lyrics-68287.html	Album: The Last In Line	"Once upon a high
The streets were gold and blue was
In the sky riders gone
Never could belong
Maybe you still can dream
Sleep through screams
While we're dying in America
Once upon a child
The carnival would stop and stay a-
While you were gone
Everything went wrong
Too soon, cartoon
Dying in America
Dying in America
In places where aces outnumber the queens
Jack is afraid of tomorrow
Colors are changing to red, white and green
As we all fall down
Once upon a hate
They told us they could fix it if we'd
Wait for awhile
Killing you with smiles
Maybe you still can dream
Sleep through screams
While we're dying in America
Dying in America
Sex, sex, sex
Even winner, even better
Don't lose out, be a winner
Same horse, same time and same now
One hundred thirty per cent American people
Would like everyone else"
Egypt (The Chains Are On)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/egypt_the_chains_are_on-lyrics-68285.html	Album: The Last In Line	"In the land of the lost horizon
Where the queen lies dark and cold
When the stars won't shine, then the story's told
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
Then the strange ones came and the people knew
That the chains are on
In the land of no tomorrow
Where you pray just to end each day
And your life just slowly melts away
Each day you hear the sand as it moves and whispers
Come and sail on my golden sea
Maybe one day you'll be just like me...and that's free
But still your chains are on
You've seen them walking on the water
You've seen flying through the sky
They were frightening in the darkness
They had rainbows in their eyes
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
The the strange ones came and the people knew
That the chains are on"
Eriel	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/eriel-lyrics-68354.html	Album: Magica	"Now that my dreams have gone dead
I see them burning in the fire
Just like the words that I've said
Ashes turned to ashes once again
Look for a sign in the air
A light that dances in the sky
Maybe you'll see it somewhere
Oh, shining like a diamond
Promising that hope will never die
I might know the answer
Well, it's back there in my brain
Someday soon I'll be rising again
Higher than the sun
I have been father and son
I cry for children of the night
Just because tears have begun
Beware of quiet voices
Thunder comes from silence - I am light
Oh, look for a sign, is it me
No don't believe with only eyes
Speak to the blind 'cause they see
Truth is just a circle
Spinning round until it meets the lies
Then dies"

They had rainbows in their eyes
When the world was milk and honey
And the magic was strong and true
The the strange ones came and the people knew
That the chains are on"
Evil On Queen Street	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/evil_on_queen_street-lyrics-68314.html	Album: Lock Up The Wolves	"Dio : Evil Eyes (1983, Dio)
===============
Hide in the midnight
Turn out the lights you see them anyway
Sail into never
They follow wherever you can go
And take you to the places you don't know
No, no
It's the call of the city
The way the blacks pretty to the purest heart
Is places of pleasure
They promise the treasure if you fly
And then there goes the soul of you and I
Oh do you ever think about the way
I caught the rainbow
I'll be there when fire makes you dance
I'm gonna give you the look
That opens up the skies
I've got evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Yes evil eyes
Ooh those eyes
Look high in the night time
Turn out the lights they see you anyway
Sail into never
They follow wherever you can go
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Evil eyes
Take your lies
Evil eyes
You've been in the skies
For what you are
Evil eyes
Sail into never
They'll follow you forever
'Cos they're evil eyes
Evil - Evil - Evil - Evil - Evil - Evil - Evil Eyes"
Evilution	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/evilution-lyrics-68312.html	Album: Strange Highways	"Spent the night on the road
And never saw the miles go
Running away
Got to get free from myself
Stories were made to be told
and here's the one that I know
I can't hide it anymore
There's evil on Queen Street
Saw the house in the dark
It seemed to say ""come touch me
I've got a heart
Open the door to my soul""
Climb to the top of my stairs
And look into my windows
I can be your wishing well
There's no evil on Queen Street
Let me inI can warm in the heat of your fire
It's no permanent sin to be bad
If you're sorry
Let me go - you're a promise that comes from a liar
I don't know - if I ever can wash all the evil away
Struck a match at the dark
It screamed no, no I love you
Together we're strong
You always believed what I'd say
But now the heat of a flame
Can start me to remember
There's no evil - evil
No evil on Queen Street
Just smoke in the air
No evil anywhere
No evil on Queen Street"
Faces In The Window	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/faces_in_the_window-lyrics-68302.html	Album: Dream Evil	"Good night, we're closing again
Come back, we're open tomorrow
We've finished today
I'm just staying away
We know what's good for the brain
Oh, plastic dreams and fast machines
Pushing it to the limit
Girls and boys who think that noise
Is music in the air
Twisted felon, stay awhile
Here's your invitation
Dirty rags and body bags
Evilution
Hello, we're open once more
Come in, you need no appointment
We're thinking in time
That you'll move down the line
And represent the business in hell
Well, well
Tell her hope is gone but you carry on
We can set the soul free
All is lost so what's it costs
To listen anyway
The world upstairs where no-one cares
Is just about to crumble
See it through we'll burn for you
Evilution company
Oh, neon names play neon games
Showing it to the public
I hate you and you hate me
And everybody smiles
So money talks and no-one walks
But everybody's crawling
Golden rags and body bags
Evilution
Hello, good night, it's me
I'm open again
Come back, come in, good bye
We're closed"
Fallen Angels	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/fallen_angels-lyrics-68291.html	Album: Sacred Heart	"Give me - shelter - shelter
I can face the day
Then I'll just fade away
Give me shelter
Give me shelter
Sleep comes - slowly
The fire starts to die
You open up your eyes
Faces in the window
Noises in the night
Faces in the window
Hiding from the light
Faces in the window
We are - evil
And we are all divine
Creations of the mind
We are pleasure
I see - clearly
Who's behind the wall
Yes, I can see us all
We're faces in the window
Noises in the night
Faces in the window
Hiding from the light
Faces in the window
Give me shelter - shelter - shelter
Give me shelter - shelter - shelter
Faces in the window
Noices in the night
Faces in the window
Hiding from the light
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
When the fire starts to die
And you open up your eyes
There they are in the window

We are evil and divine
Just creations of the mind
And faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window
Faces in the window

Feed My Head	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/feed_my_head-lyrics-68349.html	Album: Magica	"Hiding in a corner
Waiting for the storm
Maybe they'll forget about me
Avoid connection
Still they say you always surrender
All the smiling faces
Promising the sun
Another way of breaking you down
All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my head
Hope is gone
The spell's been said
Fill my mind
Feed my head
Ah
Waiting for my number
To climb upon the cross
Maybe they'll forget about me
Must avoid detection
But they say you'll still go down
Safe in dreams
Away from where they are
Let me be nowhere
Just another star
Safe in night
The shadows cloak their eyes
Take me to nowhere
Where everybody flies
Oh!
All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my head
Hope is gone
The spell's been said
Fill my mind
Feed my head
All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my head
Hope is gone
The spell's been said
Fill my mind
Feed my head
All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my head
Hope is gone
The spell's been said
Fill my mind
Feed my head
All is lost
Hope is dead
Feed my mind
Fill my head"
Fever Dreams	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/fever_dreams-lyrics-68338.html	Album: Magica	"Lately when my demons drag the night across my eyes
I just can't seem to fight it anymore
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world
But it seems that I have heard that song before
And the voices begin to sing - Come home
I have seen some evil as I've walked upon the earth
But this is way beyond what eyes can see
Wicked is as wicked does and if I lose control
Is this the way that hell is gonna be
Have I fallen too far to rise
Been burning too long in the fire
Then it all falls down - Tearing the night away
It must be - Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Now before my demons roll the night across my eyes
I tremble as I wait perhaps to sin
Yield unto temptation and be ruler of the world
And all I do is let the beast come in
Have I fallen too far to rise
I've been standing too long in the fire
Let it all fall down
Tearing the night away
It must be - Fever dreams
From the outside - Fever dreams
Oh, fever dreams
Fever dreams
Ooh-ooh
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams
Fever dreams"
Firehead	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/firehead-lyrics-68313.html	Album: Strange Highways	"Screaming out alone in the night
Just a time and place
But it's real all right
We are diamonds that shine without fire
We're climbing the stairsGoing down and never higher
Fallen Angels
Going down
Something came to me in a dream
The crack of a gun and a bloody scream
The I could see the faces and why
I was holding the gun
And the world began to die
It's a criminal world
And we all get to play
You're a criminal
Sins of the children
Never get washed away
We're Fallen Angels
Goin' down
Fallen Angels
Come gather round
Screaming out alone in the night
Just a time and placeBut it's real all right
We are diamonds that shine without fire
We are climbing the stairsGoing down and never higher
We're Fallen Angels

Is he coming closer
Well I'll just make believe
That I've never been afraid
Crackle, Crackle,
You're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead
From spooky stories that he's read
They put pictures on his body
Living out a fantasy
To be the last one left alive, hah!
Crackle, Crackle,
You're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead
He's lost the instruction
No control
Suicide fever, he won't be much older
I know, won't go, away
What's that smoke that I can see
Rising from the ashes
Well, it seems that there will always be
Someone just like you
Crackle, Crackle,
And you're all dead
Feel the heat from firehead, firehead, firehead!"
God Hates Heavy Metal	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/god_hates_heavy_metal-lyrics-68344.html	Album: Angry Machines	"[Japanese CD only]
One more nightmare
No place like home
You see a picture of angels
I see a nail in the wall
Make him over
No time to lose
And if you've heard this one before
Don't stop me
Don't stop me
We learn slowly
Evil's in the holy
Incidental
God hates heavy metal
So I know he must hate me
Lazy-crazy
Must be my name
Why are you running to nowhere
Why do you listen to noise
So if you've heard this all before
Please stop me
Please stop me
Live don't preach it
If you can't don't teach it
Accidental
God loves heavy metal
So I know he must want me
We learn slowly
Mind control is holy
Stir don't shake it
Move too fast you'll break it up
Incidental
God is heavy metal
So I know he must need me"

Daddy's at the door

Is it all beginning again tonight?
Somebody make it right!
I say: Give her the gun!
Look at him run away
Give her the gun
Before the next one comes along
And doesn't pay
He, dragged into the cold
Momma sold her soul
For one more ride to heaven
Please, someone let him in
Is it all beginning again tonight
Can anyone make it right?
I say: Give him the gun!
Look at her run away
Oh, give him the gun
Before the next one comes along
And doesn't pay
Simply unforgivable, destruction of the heart
Does anybody tell
Make yourself invisible
Be blinded by the light
We're hiding away, what would they say
Yeah
She played this song before
Daddy's at the door
Just to say hello, ahh
Now, in a different world
Is it all beginning again tonight
Oh, I got to make it right
I say: give her the gun
Look at him run away
Oh, give her the gun
Before the next one comes along
Give her the gun
Look at him falling down
Oh, give her the gun
Before the next one comes along

Don't tell another story
Another alibi

Gypsy	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/gypsy-lyrics-68272.html	Album: Holy Diver	"It's been a long hot road I've been upon
Through the desert of your soul
I've looked high and low for water
But it's not there
All the promises of springtime
Turned to lies, so cold
But I'm stronger than you know
And I've come to let you go
Chorus:
Go eat your heart out
You've been a bad, bad girl
You've been hungry all of your life
So eat it out
I've been a prisoner just locked away
Inside your velvet jail
But it don't matter at all
Some things can grow without the light
Spinning cages for her pleasure
Weaving chains to hold the prize
Magic moments with the jailerAll on fire, and then he dies
(Repeat chorus)
We speed across emotions
And then we lose our hold
We move on wings of passion
That we can't control

Heaven And Hell	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/heaven_and_hell-lyrics-68339.html	Album: Inferno: Last In Live	"Sing me a song, you're a singer
Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's heaven and hell
Oh well
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell
Fool, fool
Oh uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on and on and on and on and on
They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of kings and queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's heaven and hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's heaven and hell, oh no
Fool, fool
You've got to bleed for the dancer
Fool, fool
Look for the answer
Fool, fool, fool"
Here's To You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/heres_to_you-lyrics-68334.html	Album: Strange Highways	"She was straight from Hell
But you never could tell
Cause you were blinded by her light
She could crack your brain
With magic pain
And turn a paler shade of white
(Well) I was on the free
Just me and me
And just about to sail
When I heard the voice
Said you got a choice
The hammer or the nail
You'll be ridin'
You'll be ridin' on the gypsy
Well I rolled the bones
To see who'd own
My mind and what's within
And it's a given rule
That we're all fools
And need to have a little sin
So I'm ridin'
I've been ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen
She was straight from Hell
But you never could tell
Cause you were blinded by the light
So she cracked my brain
With magic pain
And turned my left around to right, right
So I'm ridin'
Yes I'm ridin'
I'm still ridin' on the gypsy
On the gypsy queen"

Here's to you! Here's to me!
Masters of the universe
The curse of destiny
All for one, it's one for all
Now you can pull the trigger
As we're knocking down on the wall
When you finally shoot too high
The lie will always bring it down
You resurrection angels,
Look what we found
That the wheel goes around
So here's to you!
Come on, raise the dead
Heads will roll
Cancel the infection
We can purify the soul
Do the crime
Then write the law
There's no wrong you can change it where
A change you've never saw
Hey, you desperation angels
Here we found
That they all fell down
So
Here's to me! Here's to you!
Here's to you! Here's to me!
Here's to reason!

Knocking at the door that I've been through before
Congratulations, at last you've seen my light

Now I've become the cat who always lets you know that
I am, I am, stronger than the wind
I am, I am sin
I am, I am, stronger without you
I am
For all the words come unspoken
Silence isn't gold, or the story's never told
Investigation, at last I've found my light
And we shine
So now I'm like the cat who always tells you this, that
I am, I am, stronger than the wind
I am, I am sin
I am, I am, better without you
I am
I think I'm way outside illusion
Breaking down the door that locked me in before
Congratulations, now that you've seen my light
After all
And when I become the cat, I'll always let you know that
I am, I am, stronger than the wind
I am, I am sin
I am, I am, I am, stronger without you

Knowing it could be a lie
I see how you rise
To question the eyes of anyone who promises pain
Contagious, something like a virus of love
Making the pleasure seem real
Another killing by the villain
Another body on the ground
Here comes the master of destruction again
I knew you from the start
Hunter of the heart
Cat crazy, never the predictable one
Asleep in the sun now the strike
Possession today, then send it away
After all the joys in the taking
Another beating by the villain
Another angel fallen down
Here comes the master of destruction again
Perfect for the part

Another burning by the devil
And another diamond turned to glass
Here comes the master of destruction again

And never see the end of today
Lock it up and send it away - forever

That I saw
I've heard about a rainbow
I've heard it makes you crazy
I think I'm goin' crazy
Crazy cause I see

Somewhere you'll find me
Alone swimming here in the ecstasy
If I'm silence you must be scream
But I don't hear you
I'm in a place that I've just never seen before
No, don't go
You'll never save me
I've just slapped away that helping hand you gave me

I just come seeking pleasure, I hate the light
I speed at night, at night

No vision, I only see to hear
Protection, I never needed none
Direction, just nowhere near the sun
You've go some stairs to heaven, you may be right
I only know in my world, I hate the light

You may infect yourself
Don't ever cross this line
You could see monsters in your mind
There just like me
Have I erased all sense of touch
I don't feel anything
Sometimes they say I need
Sometimes I think I need
Sometimes I know I need
New parts for my brain
Most dreams, they're black and white
But I must color mine
Each day's another end
Less night of screaming
Shouting at the outside
Someone let me in
Set me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Stop the water, bags of sand
Institutional man
Sometimes they say I need
Sometimes I think I need
Sometimes I know I need
New parts for my brain
Set me free now no-one can
Faces at the window
Lock the cages, tie my hands

Sister
Black and white
What she's gonna to do

But don't hurt your brother

They just showed me Mary
She was stoned, stoned, danger zone
There was nothing in her eyes
And then there, there in the air
Nailed to the cross was Jesus
Cross-road, overload
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray my soul to keep away

Just Another Day	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/just_another_day-lyrics-68295.html	Album: Sacred Heart	"Prime time
Nursery rhyme
Did you see the teacher
Sister
Black and white
What she's gonna to do
They say eye for eye, tooth for tooth
But don't hurt your brother
Cross-road, overload
Oh, I, I testify
They just showed me Mary
She was stoned, stoned, danger zone
There was nothing in her eyes
And then there, there in the air
Nailed to the cross was Jesus
Cross-road, overload
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray my soul to keep away
From the holy spirit, holy ghost
They're hiding in the dark
Oh, nightmare, electric chair
You might not get to heaven
Bad boys, shout for joy
Watch him to cry

Love just needs religion
Cross-road, overload"
Killing The Dragon	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/killing_the_dragon-lyrics-68350.html	Album: Killing The Dragon	"Silence - we hunt for the queen
Sign of the cross
And pray in-between
Look by the light of the day
She's hiding till dark
Waiting to play hey-hey
Something's taken a child
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again
Silence - we'll hunt for the lord
He takes crimson and gold
Gave ice to the cold
Oh to be never afraid
Of wolves at the door
Howling for more
More's been empty for years
And it all must end
Time to be killing the dragon again
Kneel and behold your new king
Digital dreams
And wonderful things to tease you
Small gods with electrical hearts
And it all will end
Time to be killing the dragon"

Living The Lie	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/living_the_lie-lyrics-784455.html	Album: Master Of The Moon	"When a million miles from nowhere
Is still too close to home
You're with a hundred thousand people
And you still feel all alone
She was never in the circle, or the round would be a square
And the more she seemed to want it, oh the less they seemed to care
Sold out and no admission
Too late to buy
It's never who, it's only why
She's living the lie, living the lie
When you're on your way to somewhere
But the elevator falls
Do you look for the stairs to heaven
Or wander through the halls
He was only dedicated to the ones who make the law
But they burned with too much fire
And his heart was made of straw
No ticket, no admission, too late to buy
It's always he and he knows why
He's living the lie, living the lie
How bad do you want it, how far will you go?
If you're looking at tomorrow
To forget about today
Then the past will be your future
And it's there you'll always stay
What about the pictures that smile from magazines
The ultimate temptation, all our kings and our queens
Such heat and too much pressure, not worth the try
No more for them, now it's I
And no more living the lie, living the lie
Oh why, live the lie"
Lock Up The Wolves	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/lock_up_the_wolves-lyrics-68319.html	Album: Lock Up The Wolves	"In the houses of the holy,
To the middle of the mystic sea,
At the craddle of the world.
There's a black cat screamin',
And it's not even midnight,
At the craddle of the world.
They're screamin' sanctuary,
They're screamin' at you,
Lock up the wolves.
Lock up the wolves.
Now there's a cloud over heaven,
And the pain of a paradise,
In your corner of the world.
Ah, turn your back on the children,
Does it feel like it's colder,
In your corner of the world.
They're screamin' sanctuary,
They're screamin' at you,
Lock up the wolves.
Lock up the wolves.
Lock up the wolves.
Lock up the wolves,
Don't you let them get away,
Lock up the wolves before you play,
Or it's over.
Lock up the wolves,
Don't you let them get away,
Don't let them get away.
There's no back door to heaven,
Just a front door to hell,
Oh, in this corner of the world.
Now if you turn your back on the children,
You'll feel it getting colder,
Ah, in your corner of the world.
They're screamin' sanctuary,
They're screamin' at you,
Oooh!
Lock up the wolves.
Lock up the wolves.
Lock them up."
Long Live Rock 'n' Roll	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/long_live_rock_n_roll-lyrics-68300.html	Album: Intermission	"Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
When the moon steals the light from the dying sun
Oh run
It's a better thing than we have ever done
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
Like the beat of a heart
Don't look behind
Cause a tear that never dies
Can only make you blind
You've got to try
Cause the future's never never gonna die
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming to get out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Tonight we run
We can hide in the dark
Till the moon steals the light from the sun
There's a beast that lives inside you
And it's screaming let me out
It's a storm that's never ending
It's a truth without a doubt
Love can be a whisper
But pain will always
Shout to you
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart
Like the beat of a heart"

So many shadows
Unholy light
Putting out the spark
Leave 'em in the dark - forever
Ooh
I can wait for you
Your end is my life
All lies are true
Secrets of the heart
And you can take them all - To heaven
I don't feel pain or sorrow
The child's a man tomorrow
Crossing the line - Then he's mine
Don't care which god you follow
Whose promises you swallow
Time and again
We must meet at the end
Aaah
It's all right
When the music is over
Come on and dance
For the lord of the last day
I love the night
So many shadows
Unholy light
Secrets of the heart
Leave 'em in the dark
Forever

Losing My Insanity	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/losing_my_insanity-lyrics-68360.html	Album: Magica	"Someone said
You'll light up the universe
It's there in your head then
Crazy comes to call
Break me down
I'm only an everyone
Running from free
Running from me
And though it's not of my choosing
I'm losing my insanity
Again
Someone said
Forever was yesterday
So open your head when
Crazy comes around
Break me down
I'm only an innocent
Howl at the moon
Knowing that soon
And though it's always confusing
I'm losing my insanity
Round and round
Like the wheels in my mind
Round and round and down and down and down
And down and down
Someone said
Believe in your otherside
It's there in your head and
Waiting for a ride
Break me down
Ah once I was everything
Breaking the law
Quick on the draw
And though it's not of my choosing
I'm losing my insanity
Again"
Magica (Reprise)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/magica_reprise-lyrics-68348.html	Album: Magica	"And the games still go on
With a warning to the bishop from the pawn
No one sees an angel till it smashes to the ground
And then you run somewhere
And leave it lying there
Then on we sail
Never thinking that the wind could ever fail
No one gets to heaven till they've lived awhile in hell
And even then it's rare
That you'll be going there
Now we understand. All traces of Magica must be eliminated.
Infection. Infection. Delete, delete, delete, delete, delete,
delete delete delete delete..."
Magica Story	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/magica_story-lyrics-68358.html	Album: Magica	"It has been a thousand years since the once powerful planet of Blessing lost its life-giving two suns, and countless millennia since the days of the great magicians. An expedition of alien voyagers came upon the now ice-covered sphere, drawn there by an unexplained lone beacon far below the miles of frozen moisture, they unlocked a written history of Blessing from its almost undiscovered tomb. So begins the story of Magica.
It was a time of celebration. The Book of Magica and the wizards who had used its spells so wisely for the good of the people were being honored in all the great cities of the world. There was however an exception. Where good thrives, evil survives and evil has plans for survival.
The celebration of thanks and prosperity would signal the forces of Evilsyde to begin the attack and ultimate capture and destruction of Magica. The spells from the Book would be used to turn all of those unwilling to join Evilsyde into statues of stone and send their spirits to Otherworld, where they would eventually be assimilated into the energy needed to drive Evilsyde, and maintain its power without the necessity of the Book and its incantations forever.
Defenses were naturally relaxed during the festive preparations and although the battle was well-fought by both factions, the minions of the dark prevailed. Their assault was well-planned and executed to a fault. After overwhelming their initial opposition, they pushed on to the sacred ground upon which the Book of Magica rested. They possessed a much weaker form of magic themselves, and although it would be normally quite useless against the strength of Magica, the inability of the Wizards to gather themselves together in time, coupled with the perfect timing and determination of the attackers, spelled doom for the Book and its followers.
The leader of the insurrection was the high priest and executioner known as Shadowcast. His presence could make the naughtiest of children become obedient and inspire great fear among the adult population. This man, most vile, would now be ruler of all and answerable to none. His reign would plunge Blessing into eternal darkness and prepare the way for the coming of his master, Astoroth, the Grand Duke of Hell.
The capture of Magica did not, however, mean that Shadowcast had finally reached his goal. He must now find and conquer Blessing's Grand Wizard and legendary hero, Eriel. Eriel, who defeated Evilsyde time and again with his understanding and use of Magica's spells. He would be the last stumbling block of total domination.
Eriel had removed himself from the general population in anticipation of everlasting peace and now he devoted all of his energy to meditation and praise of his God. Lately though, he had been visited by many temptations in his dreams. Promises of pleasure, riches and power raced through his sleeping mind. All these lures had been placed there by Shadowcast, hoping to avoid confrontation between this dominant man and his own villainous forces. Eriel however had resisted these solicitations and was now warned of some impending danger. He managed to make his way to the sacred ground by cloaking his identity with simple spells, only to be discovered just before his attempt to rescue the Book of Magica, but not before he was able to memorize the most important of Magica's charms, The spell of Restoration.
The ceremony of thanksgiving was now directed toward the transmission of spirits to Otherworld. One by one the good souls of Blessing were turned to stone and sent on to their grisly fate, until only the noble Eriel remained. The spectacle that followed was meant to degrade Eriel and raise the courage of the cowardly supplicants of Evilsyde, but true to his indominantable bearing, he promised to return and banish Evilsyde forever. Then he was gone.
The horrors of Otherworld are now revealed to the masses huddled together for some small measure of comfort. First the adults were separated from their children amid cries and pleas for help. Next the old ones were taken away and assigned to a place very near the assimilation site. They were guarded by monstrous, misshapen denizens of this shrouded netherland, who constantly harangued the inmates with promises of pain and extermination. Intermittent bursts of flame shot up from jagged cracks in the ground, threatening to consume anyone in its path. Shrieks of torment could be heard piercing the murky atmosphere, further unnerving the petrified captives. Only one seemed unaffected by all the inflicted fear and turmoil. Eriel's strength and determination soon pacified the men and women with whom he was confined. When they all became more calm and subdued, he began to speak to them softly as an adult to his children. ?Long ago you entrusted me to protect the Book of Magica and to be faithful to its special purpose. It must seem that I have failed you and condemned us all to oblivion, but fear not! This hell is only a test of your faith and resolve. The power of Magica did not vanish in fire. On the third day I will evoke the spell of Restoration. United we shall return to Blessing and, armed with the strength of Magica, we will be triumphant. Many will perish, but Magica and our souls cannot be restored until three days have passed. Take heart my friends. Victory awaits you.?
Even magic has its limitations and as Eriel explained to his flock, the spell could not be activated until a waiting period of at least three days. One third of the souls of Blessing would be melded into the Evilsyde collective before Eriel could be effective with the words of Restoration.
The old ones were the first to go. Cries of encouragement and hope were shouted to the condemned as they trudged slowly to their fate. One by one they were thrown into the assimilation chamber where a blinding blue spark gave evidence of their demise. With each burst Eriel's heavy heart ached with guilt for his part in this slaughter of his charges. If only he had not become so complacent. He above all should never have let this tragedy transpire.
In the compound holding the young adults, an insurrection of sorts was occurring. A boy of seventeen years called Challis was urging an uprising among his captured companions. Futile though it was, it earned Challis a place in the cell adjoining Eriel's. His rantings and ravings were soon quelled by Eriel's quiet urging and the two settled into serious conversation. Eriel knew his time of assimilation was near and only hoped it would not be scheduled before the three day waiting period for Restoration was ended. Shadowcast wanted to personally oversee Eriel's termination but couldn't abandon his duties on Blessing until all was secure. Would there be enough time ?
Eriel realized some of his own strong qualities in Challis and decided that this was an opportunity not to be lost. He instructed Challis to remove all anger from his mind and hate from his heart. Only the pure could receive and transmit this most important of spells. Convinced that this young man was ready, he joined with his spirit and gave him these words. ?Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna,? Words that would resurrect the masses if delivered correctly and in time.
Over two days had passed before Shadowcast was ready for travel to Otherworld to deliver Eriel to his fate. His journey through Otherworld was marked by what could pass for cheers, if they weren't shouted from the mouths of utterly inhuman shapes and forms. Upon his arrival he instructed the guards to take him straight to Eriel. Once there he announced with great satisfaction that he would personally supervise Eriel's execution in a matter of hours. Nearby, Challis loudly voiced his objection to this treatment of his newly met hero and was rewarded by kicks and punches until he could no longer speak. Eriel's heart sank. Had he misjudged Challis and entrusted his people's future to a reckless youth? Eriel's mind wandered to his own younger days. He too had been restless and foolhardy, but in time had outgrown these traits and become the adored leader of Blessing. He wondered if Challis had yet experienced love. Eriel himself had turned his back on the beautiful and innocent Annica. She was his intended from birth, but he couldn't let love for this saintly child cloud his duties to Blessing and the Book.
One hour remained in the wait for Restoration. Eriel's hopes were soaring. Surely Shadowcast would fail once again. But as that thought surfaced, so did Evilsyde's dark leader. Eriel was led away with head held high, but as he passed Challis he gave just the slightest nod. A gesture that wasn't lost on the youth. Eriel was then taken to the assimilation chamber and strapped to the cross-like structure in the middle of the room. Seconds were all that stood in the way of resurrection or destruction. Shadowcast walked to Eriel, presumably to gloat one last time to his old nemesis. Eriel welcomed the time that would be wasted, but at the last moment Shadowcast seemed to reconsider and raised his arm in signal for the end to begin. The arm dropped and, with crackle and hiss, Eriel was no more. Shadowcast and his minions erupted with joy. Never again to be slaves. Now to be masters.
Challis heard the cheering and knew that Eriel had passed without time to summon the spell. Now only he could influence the future. He heard the rattling of armor and realized they were coming for him. Soon the guards appeared and dragged the struggling Challis from his confinement. One of his jailers struck him a mighty blow across the face and suddenly all his anger left him. He was sure of what he must do. Thunder starts from silence and he would be thunder.
Challis was taken to the chamber and secured to the cross. Shadowcast approached him and asked if he had any last thing to say before assimilation. Challis smiled and said he did. Then with an evil laugh, Shadowcast raised his arm and announced that his question was only a final killing joke. It was now or never. As the arm fell in signal, Challis shouted out the spell: ?Sanasha Gorath Sollis Arcanna? and all hell actually broke loose. Challis and the good folk of Blessing were bathed in an incredible rush of light. Shadowcast and all his wicked throng writhed in agony in the darkness they were spawned from, as the fierce illumination sought them out and consumed each troll, ogre and gargoyle in a horrible melting frenzy. Shadowcast, hiding in the last black space to be found, watched the light creep irresistibly toward him. At the last moment he cloaked his body with his unpriestly robe and muttered what sounded like an oath as the light touched the cloth. The robe erupted into flame and then there was nothing. Surely Shadowcast was also consumed by fire! But that tale would not yet be told. Now as each remaining citizen of Blessing was transported instantly back to their home, they found themselves standing among thousands of recognizable stone statues. These monuments represented their fallen comrades and would ever be a lasting testament to the dangers of evil and the power of Magica.
Now came the time of mourning. Funeral pyres brightened the night sky for weeks and songs of sorrow could be heard across the land long after the flames had sputtered and died. When the prolonged periods of grieving had ended, the citizens and their council directed attention to the task of anointing a new leader and protector of the restored Book of Magica. The choice seemed a simple one. Challis had resurrected the populace and the Book, but many questioned his youth and inexperience.
The debate raged on as the time of choosing approached. The candidates were summoned to the sacred place. Eloquent speeches were made on behalf of them all. Only Challis lacked a champion and it seemed certain that he would be passed over. ?Will anyone speak for the boy?? asked the council. The question was greeted by silence as the judges turned away to cast their votes. Then the quiet was broken. A handsome woman with golden hair, now flecked with traces of gray, spoke: ?Challis must be chosen. This is the secret I have carried with me for all these years. Although I was once rebuffed by my only true love, Eriel, our brief union produced the young man standing before you. Eriel was never to know that he had sired this free spirit, but he will live on through his son's achievements if you now find him worthy.? So spoke Annica, mother of Challis.
The decision was now reached quickly. Annica's revelation left little doubt in the minds of the councillors that Challis should indeed succeed his father. Evilsyde had been defeated, Shadowcast was hopefully destroyed, Challis had been chosen to lead his people and, despite the huge number of casualties, the old way of life began again. But, evil does not easily die. Shadowcast did indeed survive and persist in his attempts to challenge and conquer Blessing. Great battles would be fought. Brave heroes would rise to the occasion and legends were created. There was, of course, the unforgettable War of the Darkpeace when Challis ?. Ah! But that's another story!"

Who are you, what are you?
Why do you scream at me?
Turn around and when you face the sun

We can shake you make you over

Shed some light upon your darkness
We need your mind

In a world that only you know

Coming through the cracks before I mend the wall
Get out 'cause you're breaking the law
How did you ever find me?
Places I can hide can't get much smaller
I have invisible dreams where no one can touch me
Maybe I'll find a way to disappear
No one moves and no one dies
Just the eyes
I've run as fast as I can
Thinking that they'll never catch me
What a waste of breath, a waste of time
Feel like digging a hole, going in even deeper
Maybe they just can't see what just can't shine
I'll be lost so no goodbyes
If no one moves then nothing dies
Just the eyes
Oh no, they've done it again
Sending out the detectives
Searching for signs of life and that means me
In my invisible dreams when no one is watching
I'd make the whole world blind and I'd be free
I'll be lost so no replies
If no one looks then no one dies
Just the eyes
Those eyes
Magic numbers, even sacrifice, I can't find a way
'Cause nothing stops the eyes
Oh oh ooh - Oh oh ooh - Oh oh ooh
Oh oh ooh - Oh oh ooh - Oh oh ooh
Oh oh ooh - Oh oh ooh - Oh oh ooh

I've fallen off the edge of the world
I've fallen from the top of the mountain

I've seen it from heaven and hell
I've seen it from the eyes of a stargazer
I want to be invisible
Just get me out of here
Could the dreamer be turning to stone

Rock and roll eyes
The color of rain bows-believer of lies
Rock and roll eyes

Guns loaded
Take aim and blow all the dreams away

It's always a Mystery, not what it seems to be
It's always a Mystery, just like you and me
We are lightning
We are flame
And we burn at the touch of a spark

So let it shine on - shine on
When you move to the rhythm of shadows
You can hide from the heat of the sun
If you dance to the beat of the darkness
You burn before the fire's begun
Then comes the night
You come alive
Chorus:
(With) night music
It keeps spinning around my head
Night music
It's all the things you never said
And anywhere you are
There's night music
Open up your arms
Let the night time in
Say the word an it begins
In the night you're the song and the singer
You can choose what the band's gonna play
Write the words under cover of moonlight
Make some magic with the things that you say
Together we can kill the day
Chorus:
Night music
It keeps spinning 'round my head
Night music
All the things that you never said
Here comes the night
You will survive
Dancing in the moonlight
Makes you feel alive
Open your arms
Let it begin
Open up the magic
Let the night time in"
One Foot In The Grave	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/one_foot_in_the_grave-lyrics-68310.html	Album: Strange Highways	"Do you like the dark
Do you like the way it moves
Do you come alive when neon
Kills the sun
Are you hypnotized
Part of the illusion
Oh, see how they run
It's the mystery
Poetry and passion
Innocence and fashion
Revolution
Evolution ways
Night people
Are you satisfied
With the lessons that you're learning
Is the fire really burning
Do you know
Hey dream child
Promises are spoken
And promises are broken
Electric eyes that never let you
See them in the day
Night people
Night people
Do you like the dark
Do you like the way it moves
Do you come alive when neon
Kills the sunshine
Are you hypnotized
Innocence and fashion
Promises and passion
Evolution
Revolution ways
And everybody stays
Night people
Night people, yeah!
Do you like the dark
Do you like the way it moves
Are you hypnotized
Paralyzed
Revolution
Hey dream child
You got electric eyes
Hey dream child!"
One More For The Road	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/one_more_for_the_road-lyrics-784449.html	Album: Master Of The Moon	"Never been here before
But I'm coming back tomorrow
For the real pain
A cold rain again
Nice day for a crucifixion
Heard a new prediction
That we can all be saved
So I'll have
One more for the road
Oh, play it again
One more for the road
Never heard this before
That a child can tell who's evil
But it's a good thing
If we sing along
Cold day
We can make a fire
Burn another liar
Can witches ever die?
Hey let's burn
One more for the road
Oh gimme the same again
One more for the road
Well I've never been here before
And the room is really empty
But there's a big line waiting for the show
Nice day for an execution
Another wrong conclusion
But someone's got to pay
So let's burn
One more for the road
Oh play it again
One more for the road
There's a child who just sees evil
And a man who just loves pain
But I've heard that we can't save them
So gimme the same again
There's a cross that you can't carry
Cause it's heavier than hell
And if you should meet your maker
Just pray that he won't yell
One more for the road
One more for the road
Play it again
One more for the road"

Can't close my eyes
Sleep is just a drug, this must be serious
This must be serious
Does this go on and on forever
Sometimes in the dark I feel invincible
I wonder why
I hear voices out of shadows
And shadows never lie
Helter skelter
Now give me shelter
Use the children like toys
Eat your lover
Then find an another
There be good little boys
Boys will be boys
I got two hands to hold you
Two arms around you
The master and the slave
Two eyes to watch you
Two hands to help you
Put one foot in the grave
Here we go again, must be delirious
Can't close my eyes, no
Sleep is just a drug, this must be serious
This must be serious
Helter skelter
Now, give me shelter
My brain is twisting again
I could be dreaming this
No, I'm screaming this
No more, no
I got two hands to hold you
Two arms around you
The master and the slave
Two eyes to watch you
Two hands to help you
Put one foot in the grave"
Otherworld	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/otherworld-lyrics-68359.html	Album: Magica	"Turn round slowly
Tell us what you see
Oh no - The fly got the spider
And now he's chasing me
Change comes slowly
But this is what you'll be
Somehow it snows in the summer
And the sun is freezing me, oh
Pain comes easy
If pleasure will let go
Oh oh - I still remember
And this is how I know
Rain falls slowly
Here it cuts you down
Oh no - We're all one another
Oh no - I'm caught in an otherworld
Rainbows and blue skies
Are black and white
Killed in their sleep by the queen
We have forsaken
Beginnings and taken the end - Amen
We've been forsaken
Beginnings and given the end - Amen
Time moves slowly
But here it never ends
Oh oh - We're all one another
Oh no - I'm caught in an otherworld"
Overlove	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/overlove-lyrics-68303.html	Album: Dream Evil	"Johnny was a dark child
He was promised to us all
But rides in the night, can lift you out of sight
When they call
Sally was a princess
She was chosen for the crown
But chains can't stop the sound
Of one night in the city
One night looking pretty
The someone opened doorways
And Johnny slipped away
Running for the bright, where dark is always light
But there's no day
The princess saw the dark child
And the dark child said her name
Come steal away, we'll play the game
Do you watch, do you see, do you know the people in me
I'm the bite, I'm the bark, I'm the scream
Are you poor, are you sure, are you holy, are you pure
I can tell you tales you just might not believe
One night in the city, one night looking pretty
One night in the city, one night looking pretty
The children shared the wonder
Of the leather and the lace
But one child went away, and one child stayed to play
For one night in the city"
Pain	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/pain-lyrics-68325.html	Album: Strange Highways	"Seems like heard this songAt least a thousand times before
He just wanted her but she wants more
So build a wall
Keep it all to herself, ooh
Always never seemed to be too much
Reaching out became a spider's touch
Wrapped in chains
Sad remains
Another victim of
Overlove
Overlove
He was just the devil in a thin disguise
Jealousy behind the greenest eyes
Turn the page
Close the cage
On another victim of
Overlove
Overlove, yeah
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove
Overlove
Mamma never left her baby all alone
Baby never knew when she was grown
Now mamma's gone
And come the dawn
You got another victim of

Push	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/push-lyrics-68361.html	Album: Killing The Dragon	"You've ridden on a carousel
So you know the feeling
As the ring slips through your fingers
Sometimes you justify it
But there's the sword
And you're bleeding once again
Before you're in a corner
Can't crawl away
Here's a way to save you
You gotta push
Get out of my way and push
You can turn the wheel
Push
One more push
You're master of the broken heart
And so you know the feeling
As your soul starts going under
Sometimes you rectify it
Then out of the blue
The hammer falls again
Before you're in the water
Can't sail away
Here's a way to save you
You gotta push
Break the body down
Oh push
Out of my way I'll push
You better push
You gotta push
Hands against the wall
And push
Out of my way we'll push
You can turn the wheel
Go on and push
Push
Push
Push

We all sing - warrior
Is there sight without sound
Most unlikely
But we got rock and roll

Take me anywhere
Rock and roll
Rock and roll
Is there someone there
Rock and roll
On the edge of the last goodbye
We all sing - warrior
Ah the brave never die
Most unlikely
Hey, send your heroes of to war
But whisper in their ear
Never cross the song police
They can tell you what you're gonna hear - again
For the sake of the left behind
We all sing Gloria
Soon forgotten by time
So unlikely
Cause we got rock and roll

Take you anywhere

Driving past the backroads of your mind
You could have turned the other way
And break down on the sanity you've found inside you
Someone said that you are fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind your smile
You scream
Scream
Scream for the crazy ones
Scream at the things you've done
Scream at the rising sun
We bless the beautiful
Let us forgive you for your sins
These must be holy ones
How could we believe they'd let us in
Oh, once I heard that they were fantasy
But in the darkness
Behind their smiles
They scream
Scream
Scream of a broken heart
Scream as they come apart
Scream cause they never started
Scream
No pain
No sympathy
You've always been so steady at the wheel
Some friend reality
You break down on the highway
About to see it my way
Scream at the crazy ones
Scream cause they all have sons
Scream as they point the gun at you
Scream at the bleeding heart
Scream cause the end won't start
Scream as you come apart again
Again, again, again..."

The young ones praise the sun
And time just slips away
Running into nowhere
Turning like a wheel
And a year becomes a day
Whenever we dream
That's when we fly
So here is a dream
For just you and I
We'll find the Sacred Heart
Somewhere bleeding in the night
Look for the light
And find the Sacred Heart
Here we see the wizard
Staring through the glass
And he's pointing right at you
You can see tomorrow
The answer and the lie
And the things you've got to do
Oh, sometimes you never fall
And ah - You're the lucky one
But oh - Sometimes you want it all
You've got to reach for the sun
And find the Sacred Heart
Somewhere bleeding in the night
Oh look to the light
You fight to kill the dragon
And bargain with the beast
And sail into a sight
You run along the rainbow
And never leave the groundAnd still you don't know why
Whenever you dream
You're holding the key
It opens the door
To let you be free
And find the Sacred Heart
Somewhere bleeding in the night
Run for the light
And you'll find the Sacred Heart
A shout comes from the wizard
The sky begins to crack
And he's looking right at you - Quick
Run along the rainbow
Before it turns to black - Attack"
Shivers	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/shivers-lyrics-784452.html	Album: Master Of The Moon	"Fingers scratching blackboards
Make cowards of the brave
A natural reaction
From the cradle to the grave
Rats and bats and spiders
And little things that crawl
Never make me tremble
I'm not bothered, not at all
Then I saw you
Something new inside of me
What's this shaking
You made me shiver, shiver
Cemetery midnights, walking on the dead
Never seemed to matter
It's all inside your head
Names are only letters
Mentioned on the stone
And if you're going somewhere
You're going in alone
Then I saw you
Something new inside of me
Felt this shaking
You gave me shivers
Magic charms and voodoo
And all those other spells
Never made impressions
And I never slept so well
If I had a nightmare
I'm sure that I would know
I really don't remember
But I'm sure it isn't so
Then I saw you
Something new inside of me
What's this shaking?
Turn out the lights, it won't matter
A bucket of blood and I'm fine
A black cat's only a color
But you can do it every time
Time-time-time-time"

You've stolen the day
Snatched it away
But I saw the sky
An I never want to die
Now you know the reason why
Oh shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So I think I'd better run
Shame on the sun
For the light you sold
I've lost my hold
On the magic flame
But now I know your name
Oh lord just go the way you came again
Oh shame on the night
You don't care what you've done
So I know I'd better run

Found it in a wishing well

You know you can be free forever
So the next time someone
Points a gun at you
Say Shoot Shoot
I don't care

Hey someone
If your chains are heavy for you

While I show you the way
This could be your lucky day

Tell a little truth with many lies
It's the only way I've found

Shout to the wind
How can you hurt me this way
Oh once it begins
It looks like it's coming to stay
Hanging from the cobwebs in your mind

And I'm leaving it today
For another institution

Every time I climb the mountain
And it turned into a hill
I promised me that I'd move on
And I will.
I, I, good for nothing
Going nowhere, so they say
Hey, someone give me blessings
For they say that I have sinned
That when I crawl inside myself
And ride into the wind
On Strange Highways
On Strange Highways
Hey you! I want your number
Don't even wonder
We do things our way here
Questions
These are forbidden
We got no answers
Believe us anyway
So here is my confession:
It's the only broken rule
Sometimes I crawl inside of me
Where I can't be the fool
On Strange Highways
On Strange Highways
Oh
You can see the other side
And you shall come over
You can't leave the other side
If you say I will
Everytime I climb the mountain
And it turned into a hill
Well, I promised me
I'd disappear
And now I know I will
So, someone give me blessings
For the times you say I've sinned
So I can crawl inside myself
And ride into the wind

Why everything's wrong

Does anybody know this place that I'm in
Why I might be alone
Imagination is a terrible thing
What if I'm wrong?
But here's what I've been thinking
It must the end of the world
Whatever happened to the rock 'n' roll song
Breaking your brain
Making you stronger
They say you never hear the bullet that kills
And I don't hear a sound
It's not about a change or revolution
What's gone today is still called substitution
Don't get emotional but we're out of time
The melody's gone
And fools have got the sunshine
If I'm mistaken and I see you again
Don't leave me alone
Maybe tomorrow could be the end of the world
Don't make wishes
Don't waste time
Call the ones you hate
You'd say I'm sorry but they'll have to wait
For the end of the world
Bye bye bye bye bye bye"

To save us from the ones who don't believe
Confess me father I have sin
But maybe the angels really sing
For the man who would be king
We laugh at your religion, you people of the sand
We have no superstition, you can read it in our hands
Forgive me father for the change we bring
But it is all for the man who would be king
Don't leave a body standing, not the holy, not the small
Deliver us from the evil
If it yours we want it all
Lately father I've been wondering
Is the devil just the man who would be king?
How can right be ever wrong?
We are glory, we are stronger than you
We never got an answer
It's just too late to ask
The bloody flag was waving
Our hearts just ran too fast
Curse me father for the chains we bring
And don't believe the man who would be king
We never got an answer, the question slipped my mind
I've been so busy killing, I haven't found the time"

Kill the spirit and you'll be blinded, the end is always the same

You've nothing to say

We don't come alone
We are fire we are stone
We're the hand that writes
Then quickly moves away
Chorus:
We'll know for the first time
If we're evil or divine
We're the last in line
We're the last in line
Two eyes from the east
It's the angel or the beast
And the answer lies betweenThe good and bad
We search for the truth
We could die upon the tooth
But the thrill of just the chase
Is worth the pain
(Repeat chorus)
We're off to the witch
We may never never never come home
But the magic that we'll feel
Is worth a lifetime
We're all born upon the cross
The throw before the toss
You can release yourself
But the only way you go is down
(Repeat chorus)"
Throw Away Children	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/throw_away_children-lyrics-68362.html	Album: Killing The Dragon	"Oh-oh, the sun's gone down
Her day begins
And the rhythm of the darkness
Wakes the dead
Don't answer eyes that smile
Don't let them in
They see the lonely child
She feels their sin
But it's getting so much colder
And she's afraid
Never going back to where the pain was
She'd rather face the pain that's here and now
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child
I'll make you safe and warm
Words she needs to hear
What they really mean is no more little girl
Don't see her anymore
They disappear
Yesterday they said that she was dying
And just today I heard that she was dead
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child
Someone's thrown away their children
You can hear them only if you try
Sing for the runaway children
Goodbye
Someone's thrown away their children
You can see them running from your smile
Sing for the runaway children
The throw-away child"
Time To Burn	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/time_to_burn-lyrics-68292.html	Album: Intermission	"Who cares what came before
We were only starlight
One day, then nevermore
Because we're whispers in the wind
Once upon a time
The world was never blind
Like we are
Right now it seems
You're only dreams and shadows
If wishes could be eagles how you'd fly
This is your life
This is your time
What if the flame won't last forever
This is your here
This is your now
Let it be magical
Who cares what came before
We're only starlight
Once upon the time
All the world was blind
Like we are
This is your life
This is your time
Look at your world
This is your life"
Turn To Stone	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/turn_to_stone-lyrics-68337.html	Album: Magica	"Welcome to sun down, welcome to the dark
Could it be that evil has heroes
Bring everybody down - Celebration
Passing of the light
Giving up your spirit to the night
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone
Just for ever
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone
Here comes a fire
We'll burn it to the ground
Inside the page lies the power
We've turned it all around - Celebration
Words have control
To take away your heart and then your soul
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone
Just for ever
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone
Oh pray for a miracle
But the wishes in the well have all gone dry
There's no way for a miracle
It's not the way you live, it's how you'll die
Welcome to sun down - Welcome to the dark
Could it be that the evil has heroes
We've turned it all around - Celebration
Words have control
To take away your heart and then your soul
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone
Just for ever
You'll turn to stone
You'll turn to stone - Turn to stone
Concerning the inhabitants of Otherworld.
There are many similarities to be found, parallel to our own society.
The individual must be absorbed. The collective must be as one. Feed my head!"
Twisted	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/twisted-lyrics-68311.html	Album: Lock Up The Wolves	"Time To Burn
Written by Ronnie James Dio
Vinny Appice
Jimmy Bain
Claude Schnell
Craig Goldie
Someone told me I would never be free
The way you are is way you'll always be
But it's all wrong
There's Time To Burn
Hurt is on the pleasure wheel
But you can't hurt if you can't feel
And you can feel - you've got something to learn
You've got Time To Burn
You were lost inside a pounding heart
Waiting for the game to start
But you won't play - you've so much to learn
Like you never say never
We'll live forever
And you've got Time To Burn
When the wolf is loose in the city
The the city will fight to survive
You can hide in the streets of the city
But no one will care
No one will know you're alive
There's Time To Burn
Someone told me I would never be free
The way you are is way you'll always be
But it's all wrong
Just never say never
We're gonna live forever
Cause you've got Time To Burn
Time To Burn"
Walk On Water	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/walk_on_water-lyrics-68323.html	Album: Lock Up The Wolves	"It's just a matter of time
He was the victim and he never saw the crime
He had invisible eyes
He told you truth but you were sure of it, lies
Chorus:
'Cause he was twisted (you could see it)
He was twisted
He was the fortunate one
He could have pulled the trigger
But he couldn't get the gun
They told him that he was blind
He didn't understand
'Cause he could see them inside
Chorus:
They were twisted
Twisted
Twisted (you could feel it they were)
Twisted
They were twisted
Twisted
Look inside any window
Come on and see the show
It's the same generation
They set you free
But they just won't let you go - no
It was a matter of timeThey told me I was guilty
So I thought I did the crime
I never learned how to cry
So when I told the truth
They were sure it was a lie
Sure that I would try
Sure of it
Sure of it 'cause I'm so
Twisted
She's twisted up inside
They're twisted
We're twisted
And when you're twisted
There's just no place to hide away"
We Rock	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/we_rock-lyrics-68267.html	Album: The Last In Line	"He's just an ordinary man
Never gonna live forever
So he takes it where he can
Too many nights without a day
For the sake of being clever
He almost lost his way
He always thought that he could fly
Till he was shot down from the sky
You can't walk on water - don't try
You can't walk on water - my my
They say there's ice inside his veins
The man of a thousand faces
Silver spoons and golden chains
He thought his heart was made of steel
But it never started pounding
Till they strapped him to the wheel
He always thought that he could fly
Till he was shot down from the sky
No matter what you try
You can't walk on water - my my
You can't walk on water - don't try
Somebody said we'll make him strong
He can give us all the answers
Tell us right and show us wrong
If you believe it, it's no lie
And there is an end to summer
'Cause the winter makes it die
He never looked above his head
And so he missed the things they said
He always thought that he could fly
Until they shot him from the sky
Chorus
No matter how you try
You can't walk on water
Can't burn the sun
You can't walk on water
Not anyone
You can't, you can't, you can't
You can't, you can't walk on water"
When A Woman Cries	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/when_a_woman_cries-lyrics-68306.html	Album: Dream Evil	"You watch their faces
You'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing
They leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Oh, can penetrate your mind
But sail on, sing a song, carry on
Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We pray to someone
But when it's said and done
It's really all the same
With just a different name
So many voices
All giving choices
If we listen they will say
Oh, we can find the way
But we'll sail on, sing a song, carry on
Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock!
We Rock
You watch their faces
You'll see the traces
Of the things they want to be
But only we can see
They come for killing
They leave and still it seems
The cloud that's left behind
Can penetrate your mind
Sail on, sing a song, carry on
Cause We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
We Rock, We Rock, We Rock, We Rock
Ride out - stand and shout - carry on
Sail on - Sing your song - carry on
Cause We Rock, We Rock, see how We Rock
We Rock
That's rock
We Rock
We Rock"
Why Are They Watching Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/why_are_they_watching_me-lyrics-68315.html	Album: Lock Up The Wolves	"Rain falls
Thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky
Everywhere
Stars move
They're shakin' all the earth
Show you what you're worth
Here it comes
When a woman cries
Fire
Burning through your brain
Turn to face the train
Oh oh
Hey it's magic
Said the mother to the child
It's stronger than a smile
Let it go
When a woman cries
When a woman cries, ah
When a woman cries
When a woman cries, ah
Just when you think it's pretend
Here it comes over and over again
And if we should live forever
Maybe we'll still just never know
Oh, rain falls
Thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky
Everywhere
Stars move
Shakin' all the earth
Show you what you're worth
Here it comes
When a woman cries
Fire - magic
Shakin' all the earth
When a woman cries
Oh, stars move
Thunder cracks the air
Lightning from the sky
When a woman cries
When a woman cries, ah
When a woman cries, yeah
When a woman cries, ooh"
Wild One	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dio/wild_one-lyrics-68308.html	Album: Lock Up The Wolves	"He was ready to rock and roll
Ready to lose control
But when a hungry heart
Gets a taste of freedom - look out
He was ready to push and shove
Ready to fight for love
But I've seen it before
And it can make you crazy
The eyes are what. you see
Chorus:
Why are they watching me
She was ready to black and white
The colors were Just too bright
She loved to fly
But she hated failing
She was caught in the in-between
Her dirty would not come clean
She ran for light
But she just got darkness
Just when you think you're free
The eyes are what you see
Chorus:
Why are they watching me
Why do they do the things they do
Why are they watching me
Watching you
If only the eyes could see
Then you'd know your destiny
The mind is an enemy
And you just need a friend
Are you ready to rock and roll
Ready to take control
If you see the eyes
Will it make you crazy-crazy
Crazy
Chorus"
