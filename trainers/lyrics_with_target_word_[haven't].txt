That I haven't had yet
										(guns_n_roses, "Anything Goes")

Case you haven't heard
										(guns_n_roses, "My Michelle")

I haven't met her, maybe too late
										(guns_n_roses, "New Rose")

An you haven't grown up yet
										(guns_n_roses, "You Could Be Mine")

Don't be a fool you haven't reached your peak
										(queen, "Hang On In There")

To be honest you haven't got a clue
										(queen, "I'm Going Slightly Mad")

Were so warm and tender, Now haven't anything to grow
										(queen, "Nevermore")

I haven't got room for a broken heart.
										(roxette, "Como La Lluvia En El Cristal")

I haven't got a clue what is wrong, what is right, what is left to do
										(roxette, "Make My Head Go Pop")

Guess I haven't been around
										(roxette, "You Turn Me On")

The words to say I'm sorry, I haven't found yet
										(bob_dylan, "Ballad In Plain D")

And you haven't got a friend
										(bob_dylan, "Death Is Not The End")

haven't you looked?"
										(bob_dylan, "Highlands")

I haven't known peace and quiet for so long I can't remember what it's like.
										(bob_dylan, "Idiot Wind")

I know you haven't made your mind up yet
										(bob_dylan, "Make You Feel My Love")

You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right?
										(bob_dylan, "Orange Juice Blues")

You haven't been right with me, why don't you get right?
										(bob_dylan, "Orange Juice Blues (Blues For Breakfast)")

And we haven't even started yet
										(bob_dylan, "Tight Connection To My Heart (Has Anybody Seen My Love)")

I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.
										(bob_dylan, "Wedding Song")

You haven't made your peace
										(within_temptation, "Dark Wings")

And we haven't learned
										(within_temptation, "Our Solemn Hour")

But then again I haven't the guts
										(depeche_mode, "A Photograph Of You")

And I haven't felt so alive
										(depeche_mode, "But Not Tonight")

No I haven't been getting anywhere
										(depeche_mode, "Freelove")

And I haven't been getting anywhere
										(depeche_mode, "Freelove")

You haven't got a hold at all
										(depeche_mode, "Get The Balance Right")

I haven't ate in days
										(blondie, "Fan Mail")

And I haven't slept in days and days, days and days
										(blondie, "Fan Mail")

I've said that my music will play second love to none, but you haven't learned to love yourself, you had to be the only one.
										(blondie, "Now I Know You Know")

I've been so busy killing, I haven't found the time
										(dio, "The Man Who Would Be King")

And I know we haven't long
										(u2, "11 O'Clock Tick Tock")

A painted face and I know we haven't long
										(u2, "11 O'clock Tick Tock (Live From Boston 1981)")

But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
										(u2, "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For")

We haven't been to bed in a week
										(u2, "Last Night On Earth (Live From Mexico City)")

To hear the things you haven't said
										(u2, "Miracle Drug")

That I haven't already heard
										(u2, "Stuck In A Moment")

That I haven't already heard
										(u2, "Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of")

That I haven't already heard
										(u2, "Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of (Accoustic Version)")
