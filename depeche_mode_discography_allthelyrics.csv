(Set Me Free) Remotivate Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/set_me_free_remotivate_me-lyrics-515930.html	Album: Speak Spell	"Set me free
Set me free
Remotivate me
Set me burning
After years in deep freeze
My body is yearning
For a new lease of life
And a little spice
Set me free
Remotivate me
Give me a reason
To scream and shout
Give me something
To get excited about
When everything is looking dull
I'm sure it isn't impossible to
Set me free
Remotivate me
Remotivate me
Set me burning
After years in deep freeze
My body is yearning
For a new lease of life
And a little spice
Set me free
Remotivate me
Don't think I'm impatient
Because I'm willing to wait
But something must must happen
Before it gets too late
It could be my imagination
But wasn't there more than this dull sensation
Set me free
Remotivate me"
A Photograph Of You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/a_photograph_of_you-lyrics-46408.html	Album: People Are People	"What good is a photograph of you
Everytime I look at it
It makes me feel blue
What use is a souvenir
Of something we once had
When all it ever does is
Make me feel bad
I wish I could tear it up
But then again I haven't the guts
I wish I could throw it on the fire
I wish I could
But to say I would
I'd be a liar
What good is a colour print
Of a little baby doll
When just one little glance
Is enough to make me feel dull
I hoped I would misplace it
But then I take such good care of it
I wish it would disappear
I say I wish
But then I relish
It being here"
A Question Of Time	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/a_question_of_time-lyrics-46473.html	Album: The Singles 86>98	"Fragile
Like a baby in your arms
Be gentle with me
I'd never willingly
Do you harm
Apologies
Are all you ever seem to get from me
But just like a child
You make me smile
When you care for me
And you know...
It's a question of lust
It's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting
What we've built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Independence
Is still important for us though (we realise)
It's easy to make
The stupid mistake
Of letting go (do you know what I mean)
My weakness
You know each and every one (it frightens me)
But I need to drink
More than you seem to think
Before I'm anyone's
And you know...
It's a question of lust
It's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting
What we've built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together
Kiss me goodbye
When I'm on my own
But you know that I'd
Rather be home
It's a question of lust
It's a question of trust
It's a question of not letting
What we've built up
Crumble to dust
It is all of these things and more
That keep us together"
A Song For Europe	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/a_song_for_europe-lyrics-440728.html	Album: Speak Spell	"Here
As I sit
At this empty cafe
Thinking of you
I remember
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again
Though the world
Is my oyster
It's only a shell
Full of memories
Here by the Seine
Notre-Dame casts
A long lonely shadow
Now only sorrow
No tomorrow
There's no today for us
Nothing is there
For us to share
But yesterday
This is my song
This is my song
This is my song
These cities may change
But there always remains
My obsession
Through silken waters
My gondola glides
And the bridge
it sighs
I remember
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again
There's no more time for us
Nothing is there
For us to share
But yesterdays
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again
All those moments
Lost in wonder
That we'll never
Find again"
Addiction	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/addiction-lyrics-434216.html	-	"I can't help it, I'm not sure what to do
Does seem crazy, no good for my health
I've seen the doctor, he's come to look at me
If you don't believe it, don't believe
Closer all the time, Closer all the time
Closer all the time, Closer all the time

And Then...	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/and_then-lyrics-46422.html	Album: Some Great Reward	"Let's take a map of the world
Tear it into pieces
All of the boys and the girls
Will see how easy it is
To put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse
All that we need at the start's
Universal revolution (that's all)
And if we trust in our hearts
We'll find the solution's
To put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse
Took a plane across the world
Got in a car
And when I reached my destination
I hadn't gone far
Let's take the whole of the world
The mountains and the sand
Let all the boys and the girls
Shape it in their hands
To put it all down and start again
From the top to the bottom and then
I'll have faith, or I prefer
To think that things couldn't turn out worse"
Any Second Now	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/any_second_now-lyrics-46389.html	Album: Construction Time Again	"She remembered all the shadows and the doubts
The same film
Vivid pictures like a wall that's standing empty
And the night so still
Such a small affair a relapse someone closing
Like the nightclub door
Here again and when you speak I watch you move away
And seem so sure
She is hoping to forget and the moment
Almost slips away
When the colours move apart and I wonder
If you want to stay
And I need to change you like the words I'm reading
Don't you understand
This the warning and the message I remember
As you touch my hand"
Barrel Of A Gun	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/barrel_of_a_gun-lyrics-46548.html	Album: The Singles 86>98	"Do you mean this horny creep
Set upon weary feet
Who looks in need of sleep
That doesn't come
This twisted, tortured mess
This bed of sinfulness
Who's longing for some rest
And feeling numb
What do you expect of me
What is it you want
Whatever you've planned for me
I'm not the one
A vicious appetite
Visits me each night
And won't be satisfied
Won't be denied
An unbearable pain
A beating in my brain
That leaves the mark of Cain
Right here inside
What am I supposed to do
When everything that I've done
Is leading me to conclude
I'm not the one
Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun
Is there something you need from me
Are you having your fun
I never agreed to be
Your holy one
Whatever I've done
I've been staring down the barrel of a gun"
Behind The Wheel	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/behind_the_wheel-lyrics-46490.html	Album: The Singles 86>98	"My little girl
Drive anywhere
Do what you want
I don't care
Tonight
I'm in the hands of fate
I hand myself
Over on a plate
Now
Oh little girl
There are times when I feel
I'd rather not be
The one behind the wheel
Come
Pull my strings
Watch me move
I do anything
Please
Sweet little girl
I prefer
You behind the wheel
And me the passenger
Drive
I'm yours to keep
Do what you want
I'm going cheap
Tonight
You're behind the wheel tonight"
Black Celebration	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/black_celebration-lyrics-46484.html	Album: Violator	"Let's have a black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight
To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day
I look to you
How you carry on
When all hope is gone
Can't you see
Your optimistic eyes
Seem like paradise
To someone like
Me
I want to take you
In my arms
Forgetting all I couldn't do today
Black celebration
Black celebration
Tonight
To celebrate the fact
That we've seen the back
Of another black day
I look to you
And your strong belief
Me, I want relief
Tonight
Consolation
I want so much
Want to feel your touch
Tonight
Take me in your arms
Forgetting all you couldn't do today

I'll drink to that
Black celebration

Blasphemous Rumours	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/blasphemous_rumours-lyrics-46442.html	Album: The Singles 81>85	"Girl of 16
Whole life ahead of her
Slashed her wrists
Bored with life
Didn't succeed
Thank the lord
For small mercies
Fighting back the tears
Mother reads the note again
16 candles burn in her mind
She takes the blame
It's always the same
She goes down on her knees
And prays
I don't want to start
Any blasphemous rumours
But I think that God's
Got a sick sense of humour
And when I die
I expect to find Him laughing
Girl of 18
Fell in love with everything
Found new life
In Jesus Christ
Hit by a car
Ended up
On a life support machine
Summer's day
As she passed away
Birds were singing
In the summer sky
Then came the rain
And once again
A tear fell
From her mother's eye"
Blue Dress	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/blue_dress-lyrics-46508.html	Album: Songs Of Faith And Devotion - Live	"Put it on
And don't say a word
Put it on
The one that I prefer
Put it on
And stand before my eyes
Put it on
Please don't question why
Can you believe
Something so simple
Something so trivial
Makes me a happy man
Can't you understand
Say you believe
Just how easy
It is to please me
Because when you learn
You'll know what makes the world turn
Put it on
I can feel so much
Put it on
I don't need to touch
Put it on
Here before my eyes
Put it on
Because you realise
And you believe
Something so worthless
Serves a purpose
It makes me a happy man
Can't you understand
Say you believe
Just how easy
It is to please me
Because when you learn
You'll know what makes the world turn"
Boys Say Go!	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/boys_say_go-lyrics-46397.html	Album: Construction Time Again	"You don't understand
This is a demand
And I think that I have to show you
Try to look inside
Take me for a ride
In the day and the night
Get to know you
Boys meet boys get together
Boys meet boys live forever
Don't say no
Boys say go
I can run away
If you never stay
And the rain and the pain and the sorrow
I'm not very sure
When you close the door
If the end is the same as tomorrow
Boys!
Boys!
Boys say go!"
Breathe	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/breathe-lyrics-33730.html	Album: Exciter	"I heard a rumour
They travel far
You know what it's like
The way people are
They talk and they talk
Though they don't understand
They'll whisper and whisper
And lie on demand
Please tell me now
I want to know
I have to hear it from your lips
Say it's not so
 
I heard it on Monday
And I laughed a while
I heard it on Tuesday
I managed to smile
I heard it on Wednesday
My patience was tried
I heard it on Thursday
And I hurt inside
I want to know
The depths of your mind
Tell me this whole thing is madness
And we're doing fine
Put your little hand in mine
And believe in love
Put your head on my chest
And breathe love
Breathe love
Breathe love
Breathe love
 
I heard it from Peter
Who heard it from Paul
Who heard it from someone
I don't know at all
I heard it from Mary
Who heard it from Ruth
Who swore on the bible
She's telling the truth
I heard it from Simon
Who heard it from James
Confirming with Sarah
That I was to blame
I heard it from Joseph
Who heard it from John
Who said with conviction
That all hope was gone
So I need to know
Your alibis
I need to hear that you love me
Before you say goodbye
Before you say goodbye
Before you say goodbye
Before you say goodbye"

Let me see you
Stripped down to the

But Not Tonight	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/but_not_tonight-lyrics-46371.html	Album: Music For The Masses	"Oh God it's raining
But I'm not complaining
It's filling me up with new life
The stars in the sky
Bring tears to my eyes
They're lighting my way tonight
And I haven't felt so alive
In years
Just for a day
On a day like today
I'll get away from this constant debauchery
The wind in my hair
Makes me so aware
How good it is to live tonight
And I haven't felt so alive
In years
The moon
Is shining in the sky
Reminding me
Of so many other nights
But they're not like tonight
Oh God it's raining
And I'm not containing
My pleasure at being so wet
Here on my own
All on my own
How good it feels to be alone tonight
And I haven't felt so alive
In years
The moon
Is shining in the sky
Reminding me
Of so many other nights
When my eyes had been so red
I'd been mistaken for dead
But not tonight"
Clean	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/clean-lyrics-46507.html	Album: Songs Of Faith And Devotion - Live	"Clean
The cleanest I've been
An end to the tears
And the in-between years
And the troubles I've seen
Now that I'm clean
You know what I mean
I've broken my fall
Put an end to it all
I've changed my routine
Now I'm clean
I don't understand
What destiny's planned
I'm starting to grasp
What is in my own hands
I don't claim to know
Where my holiness goes
I just know that I like
What is starting to show
Sometimes
As years go by
All the feelings inside
Twist and they turn
As they ride with the tide
I don't advise
And I don't criticise
I just know what I like
With my own eyes
Sometimes
Sometimes"
Comatose	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/comatose-lyrics-33727.html	Album: Exciter	"Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in
And Sliding out
Of conscious feeling
Take a light
Start the flame
Play the game
I am lost
In your eyes
Hypnotised
Here I believe
Dreams never deceive
Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in
And sliding out
Life has no meaning
Bodies move
Colours change
Girl you're strange
Here inside
I'm at home
I'm alive
Don't be afraid
I'm floating away
Comatose, almost
You've got me dreaming
Slipping in
And sliding out
Of conscious feeling
Comatose, almost

I'll be waiting patiently
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently
Walking a thin white line between love and hate
Wasting all my time in another world
In another place
I could use a little company
A little kindness could go a long way
Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting patiently
Come back, come back to me
I'll be waiting here patiently
Light will always shine in the heart of you
In truth and in reality
Only blindness can hide it away
I could use a little restraint
A little kindness can go a long way
Weeks turn into months
Months turn into years
Reaching the same conclusions
Gathering up the fear
Living the same delusions
Gathering up the fear
Gathering up the fear
Gathering up the fear
Gathering up the fear
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back
Come back"
Coming Back To You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/coming_back_to_you-lyrics-440727.html	Album: Speak Spell	"Maybe I'm still hurting
I can't turn the other cheek
But you know that I still love you
It's just that I can't speak
I looked for you in everyone
And they called me on that too
I lived alone but I was only
Coming back to you
Ah they're shutting down the factory now
Just when all the bills are due
And the fields they're under lock and key
Though the rain and the sun come through
And springtime starts but then it stops
In the name of something new
And all the senses rise against this
Coming back to you
And they're handing down my sentence now
And I know what I must do
Another mile of silence while I'm
Coming back to you
There are many in your life
And many still to be
Since you are a shining light
There's many that you'll see
But I have to deal with envy
When you choose the precious few
Who've left their pride on the other side of
Coming back to you
Even in your arms I know
I'll never get it right
Even when you bend
To give me comfort in the night
I've got to have your word on this
Or none of it is true
And all I've said was just instead of
Coming back to you"
Compulsion	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/compulsion-lyrics-440726.html	Album: Speak Spell	"Charms in limited supply
And refusing to stretch

Got to move on sometime
And it's about time
By putting one foot in front on another
And repeating the process
Cross over the street
You're free to change your mind
Strength through diversity
Couldn't have put it more plainly

Under threat of extinction

Tried
Here on the stand
With the book in my hand
And truth on my side
Accusations
Lies
Hand me my sentence
I'll show no repentance
I'll suffer with pride
If for honesty
You want apologies
I don't sympathize
If for kindness
You substitute blindness
Please open your eyes
Condemnation
Why
Because my duty
Was always to beauty
And that was my crime
Feel elation
High
To know I can trust this
Fix of injustice
Time after time
If you see purity
As immaturity
Well it's no surprise
If for kindness
You substitute blindness

Think you're so sweet
What are you trying don't even tempt me
Soon you'll be crying, unwishing you dreamt of be

When you need someone to blame
I could corrupt you
It would be easy
Watching you suffer
Girl, it would please me
But I wouldn't touch you
With my little finger
I know it would crush you
My memory would linger
You'd be crying out in pain
Begging me to play my games
I could corrupt you
It would be ugly
They could sedate you
But i wanna touch you with my hands on your hips
It would be too much to
Place my lips on your lips

Begging me to play my games"

Dream On	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/dream_on-lyrics-33721.html	Album: Exciter	"As your bony fingers close around me
Long and spindly
Death becomes me
Heaven can you see what I see
Hey you pale and sickly child
You're death and living reconciled
Been walking home a crooked mile
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you
But careful what you're giving
There's no time for hesitating
Pain is ready, pain is waiting
Primed to do it's educating
Unwanted, uninvited kin
It creeps beneath your crawling skin
It lives without it lives within you
Feel the fever coming
You're shaking and twitching
You can scratch all over
But that won't stop you itching
Can you feel a little love
Can you feel a little love
Dream on dream on
Blame it on your karmic curse
Oh shame upon the universe
It knows its lines
It's well rehearsed
It sucked you in, it dragged you down
To where there is no hallowed ground
Where holiness is never found
Paying debt to karma
You party for a living
What you take won't kill you

Dreaming Of Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/dreaming_of_me-lyrics-46398.html	Album: The Singles 81>85	"Light switch
Man switch
Film was broken only then
All the night
Fused tomorrow
Dancing with a distant friend
Filming and screning
I picture the scene
Filming and dreaming
Dreaming of me
So we left
Understanding
Cleancut so we're sounding fast
Talked of sad
I talked of war
I laughed and climbed the rising cast
Quickly I remembered
Fused and saw a face before
Timing reason
Understanding
Like association hall"
Dressed In Black	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/dressed_in_black-lyrics-46466.html	Album: Music For The Masses	"She's dressed in black again
And I'm falling down again
Down to the floor again
I'm begging for more again
But oh what can you do
When she's dressed in black
My mind wanders endlessly
On paths where she's leading me
With games that she likes to play
And words that she doesn't say
Not when whe're alone
And she's dressed in black
As a picture of herself
She's a picture of the world
A reflection of you
A reflection of me
And it's all there to see
If you only give in
To the fire within
Dressed in black again
Shadows fall onto me
As she stands there over me
And waits to encompass me
I lay here helplessly
But oh what can you do
When she's dressed in black
Dressed in black again"
Enjoy The Silence	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/enjoy_the_silence-lyrics-46511.html	Album: The Singles 86>98	"Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little girl
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasures remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm"
Everything Counts	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/everything_counts-lyrics-46429.html	Album: The Singles 81>85	"The handshake seals the contract
From the contract there's no turning back
The turning point of a career
In Korea being insincere
The holiday was fun-packed
The contract, still intact
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves - after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves - after all
It's a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts
The graph on the wall
Tells the story of it all
Picture it now see just how
The lies and deceit gained a little more power
Confidence - taken in
By a suntan and a grin
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves - after all
The grabbing hands grab all they can
All for themselves - after all
It's a competitive world
Everything counts in large amounts
The grabbing hands grab all they can
Everything counts in large amounts"

Flexible	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/flexible-lyrics-46367.html	Album: Disc 1	"Fame
Can have strange effects
Money

I ask myself
Is it a sin

Open the window and out go ideals
Drink
Can alter you

We all know cars are fast"

Come here
Kiss me

This place seems so familiar
But then I can't be sure
Here comes that time again when
You'll walk right out the door
Don't tell me secrets anymore
And fools don't run away
You'll be followed another day
And all the chances that fall your way
Are in the fire on your dying day
So call me now and tell me that you're home
Can't see the sense in crying
There's too many tears to fall
My thoughts are multiplying
So I'll try to save them all"
Fragile Tension	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/fragile_tension-lyrics-1306083.html	Album: Sounds Of The Universe	"There's a fragile tension,
That's keeping us going
It may not last forever,
But oh well it's blowing
There's something magical in the air
Something so tragic we had to care
There's a strange obsession,
That's drawing us nearer
We don't understand it
It never gets clearer
There's something mystical in our dreams
So simplistic it kicks and screams
All we will seem to reek on the edge of collapse
Nothing can keep us down
There's a dizzying feeling,
That's keeping us flying
Some glittering gauntlet
Without even trying
There's something radical in our hands
Nothing logical to our plans"

Deep in your imagination
Tune into the lonely voices
Talking of their only choices
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your spirit grow
Step out of your cage
And onto the stage
It's time to start
Playing your part
Freedom awaits
Open the gates
Open your mind
Freedom's a state
I can taste the tears falling
The bitterness inside you calling
Yearning for a liberation
Emotional emancipation
Let yourself go
Let yourself go
Let your senses overflow
Step out of your cage
And onto the stage
It's time to start
Playing your part
Freedom awaits
Open the gates
Open your mind
Freedom's a state"

You have the ability
Get right with me
Friends, if you´ve lost your way
You will find it again some day
Come down from you pedestals
And open your mouths that´s all
Get Right with me
Life is such a short thing
Thats I cannot comprehend
But if this life were a
bought thing
There are ways I know
we´d mend
People, take my advice
Already told you once, once
or twice
Donn´t wast your energy
Making apologies
Get right with me"

Understand, learn to demand,
Compromise,
sometimes lie

right
Be responsible, respectable,
Stable but
gullible
Concerned and caring, help the helpless
But always remain
ultimately selfish
Get the balance right, get the balance
right
You think you've got a hold of it
all
You haven't got a hold at all
When you reach the top, get ready to
drop
Prepare yourself for the fall, you're gonna fall
It's almost
predictable
Don't take this way, don't take that
way
Straight down the middle until next Thursday
Push to the left, back to
the right
Twist and turn 'til you've got it right
Get the balance right"

True happiness cannot be tried
So easily

Like shackles on your feet

And in your head it's worse
There's a pain
A famine in your heart
An aching to be free
Can't you see
All love's luxuries
Are here for you and me
And when our worlds
They fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it
Bring your chains
Your lips of tragedy
And fall into my arms
And when our worlds
They fall apart
When the walls come tumbling in
Though we may deserve it
It will be worth it"

Happiest girl I ever knew
Wanted to feel the joy
Pass between our eyes
Wanted to feel the joy
Pass between our thighs
And I would have to pinch her
Just to see if she was real
Just to watch the smile fade away
And see the pain she'd feel
Wanted to feel her joy
Feel it deep within
Wanted to feel her joy
Penetrate my skin
Happiest girl I ever knew
Why do you smile the smile you do"

And there's someone
Calling on the telephone
Let's stay home
It's cold outside
And I have so much
To confide to you
With or without words
I'll confide everything
Here is the house
Where it all happened
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together
And as it happens
It happens here
In this house
So we stay at home
And I'm by your side
And you know
What's going on inside
Inside my heart
Inside this house
And I just want to
Let it out for you
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
And I feel your warmth
And it feels like home
Here is the house
Where it all happened
Those tender moments
Under this roof
Body and soul come together
As we come closer together"

This burning inside is so real
I can almost lay my hands upon
The warm glow that lingers on
Moved, lifted higher
Moved, my soul's on fire
Moved, by a higher love
I surrender all control
To the desire that consumes me whole
And leads me by the hand to infinity
That lies in wait at the heart of me
Moved, lifted higher
Moved, my soul's on fire
Moved, by a higher love
Heaven bound on the wings of love
There's so much that you can rise above
Moved, lifted higher
Moved, moved, by a higher love
By a higher love
I surrender heart and soul
Sacrificed to a higher goal
Moved, moved by a higher love
By a higher love"

When you get, what you need
It's no way of knowing
What you get is another hole to feed
Your name was the one that was always chosen
Your words and the kindness that set me free
Words can leave you broken inside
You'll have to decide
I'm hanging onto my pride
We are here, we can love
We share something
I'm sure that you'll mean the world to me
The shame as a hole that has kept us frozen
You open my eyes to the world I could believe
This world has left me broken inside
I'll have to decide
I'm hanging onto my pride
Words can leave you broken inside
You'll have to decide

Huckleberry	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/huckleberry-lyrics-127621.html	-	"Just off of the two-lane where the school bus used to stop
Was a little wooden A-frame with a yellow tin roof top
One day it was raining on this world
She said 'have you ever really, really ever kissed a girl?'
Baby I'll be your Huckleberry, you don't have to double dare me
If the storm gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
You're so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
We'll grow up and we'll get married
I'm gonna be your Huckleberry
Later on that summer we went to the county fair
They had a brand new roller-coaster and everyone was scared
It was two bucks to experience the thrill
She said 'come on boy let's get in line, I'll ride it if you will'
Baby I'll be your Huckleberry, you don't have to double dare me
If the ride gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
You're so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
We'll grow up and we'll get married
I'm gonna be your Huckleberry
Snuck off on a slow dance at the junior/senior prom
Went lookin for some romance before I had to get her home
Steamin up the windows of my car
She said 'until I get my wedding ring boy we can't go that far'
Baby I'll be your Huckleberry, you don't have to double dare me
If the world gets wild and scary count on me to be right there
You're so extra ordinary sweet like maraschino cherries
We grew up and we got married
Now look at those three little Huckleberries"

So entwined now that we can't shake free
I am you and you are me
No escaping from the mess we're in
So much pleasure that it must be sin
I must live with this reality
I am yours eternally
There's no turning back
We're in this trap
No denying the facts
No, no, no
No excuses to give
I'm the one you're with
We've no alternative
No, no, no
Dark obsession in the name of love
This addiction that we're both part of
Leads us deeper into mystery
Keeps us craving endlessly
Strange compulsions that I can't control
Pure possession of my heart and soul
I must live with this reality
I am you and you are me
I am you and you are me
I am you and you are me
I am you and you are me
There's no turning back
We're in this trap
No denying the facts
No, no, no
No excuses to give

Getting hot, never stop

New day turn away
Wipe away the tear
New night, feel right
Knowing that you're here
Dancing with you all the time, and don't you think that it's a crime
Back street never meet
Never say goodbye

But I don't know why
You say that it's from above, and I say this is modern love"

And it's showing through
Reach out your hands
And accept my love
We've waited for too long
Enough is enough
I want you now
My heart is aching
My body is burning
My hands are shaking
My head is turning
You understand
It's so easy to choose
We've got time to kill
We've got nothing to lose
I want you now
And I don't mean to sound
Like one of the boys
That's now what I'm trying to do
I don't want to be
Like one of the boys
I just want you now
Because I've got a love
A love that won't wait
A love that is growing
And it's getting late
Do you know what it means
To be left this way
When everyone's gone
And the feelings they stay
I want you now"

The darkroom scene
Darkroom scene
A letter
Once composed
Seven years long and as tall as a tree
Reading
On the wall
Emissions, efficiency
Efficiency
Efficiency
Resurrect
As a feeling
On my window
Of a past reunion
Resurrect
As a feeling
On my window
Of a past reunion
Vision
Of a picture
Like the city
And the air we breathe
The air we breathe
Air we breathe
She stood beside me once again
I knew her face
We met before in the street
Recalling all the children dancing at our feet
The dancing feet, dancing feet"

We could build a building site
From the bricks of shame is built the hope
If you want to be with me
If you want to be with me
Even though you may still not want to
Let tomorrow and today
Bring a life of ecstacy
Wipe away your tears of confusion
If you want to be with me
If you want to be with me
You can come with me if you want to

I just want to say
That I could never forget the way
You told me everything
By saying nothing
In a manner of speaking
I don't understand
How love in silence becomes reprimand
But the way I feel about you
Is beyond words
Oh give me the words
Give me the words
That tell me nothing
Oh give me the words
Give me the words
That tell me everything
In a manner of speaking
Semantics won't do
In this life that we live
We only make do
And the way that we feel
Might have to be sacrificed
So in a manner of speaking
I just want to say
That like you I should find a way
To tell you everything
By saying nothing
Oh give me the words
Give me the words
That tell me nothing
Oh give me the words
Give me the words
Give me the words
Give me the words
Give me the words"

Has got me yearning
The way you move
Has left me burning
I know you know what you're doing to me
I know my hands will never be free
I know what it's like to be
In chains
The way you move
Is meant to haunt me
The way you move
To tempt and taunt me
I know you knew on the day you were born
I know somehow I should've been warned
I know I walk every midnight to dawn
In Chains
In chains, I'm in chains
In chains, I'm in chains
You've got me dying for you
Its you that I'm living through
You've got me praying to you
Saying to you anything you want me to
You've got me reaching for you
My souls beseeching me too
You've got me singing to you
Bringing to you anything you ask me to
The way you move
Is mesmerizing
The way you move
Is hypnotizing
I know I crumble when you are around
Start to mumble a bit of a false sound
Straggle, stumble, shackled and bound
In chains
In chains, I'm in chains
In chains, I'm in chains
You've got me dying for you
Its you that I'm living through
You've got me praying to you
Saying to you anything you want me to
You've got me reaching for you
My souls beseeching me too
You've got me singing to you
Bringing to you anything you ask me to

In Sympathy	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/in_sympathy-lyrics-1306085.html	Album: Sounds Of The Universe	"They're almost falling over you
Why don't they call a truce
What ever they are trying to do
Its of little use
They're drowning you in compliments
Trying to furnish proof
Although they speak with eloquence
There is little truth
You're bright, you're strong, you know the right from wrong
At least to some degree
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough
You smile in sympathy
I'm watching your serenity
The way your so transense
The tidiest absurdities
Your patience never ends
And as the night begins to fade
Your heading for the door
Followed by sad parade
Your on your own once more
You're bright, you're strong, you know the right from wrong
At least to some degree
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough
You smile in sympathy
You're bright, you're strong, you know the right from wrong
At least to some degree
You're wise, you're tough, you've heard their lies enough

In Your Memory	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/in_your_memory-lyrics-46380.html	Album: A Broken Frame	"Put up the barriers
Shut down your senses
Cover up with all of your pretences
See no evil
Your eyes are blunted
We are the hunters
We are the hunted
Place it in your memory
Leave it in your past
But don't forget
Taking a tumble
I'm taking a dive
Sometimes I stumble when my mind's made up
Reaction levels
Seem strangely muted
Ordinary acts of fun have been diluted
Place it in your memory
Leave it in your past
But don't forget"

Where time stands still

Will you let the morning come soon
Or will you leave me lying here
In your favourite darkness
Your favourite half-light
Your favourite consciousness
Your favourite slave
In your room
Where souls disappear
Only you exist here
Will you lead me to your armchair
Or leave me lying here
Your favourite innocence
Your favourite prize
Your favourite smile
Your favourite slave
I'm hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here
In your room
Your burning eyes
Cause flames to arise
Will you let the fire die down soon
Or will I always be here
Your favourite passion
Your favourite game
Your favourite mirror
Your favourite slave
I'm hanging on your words
Living on your breath
Feeling with your skin
Will I always be here
Will I always be here"
Insight	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/insight-lyrics-46537.html	Album: Disc 1	"This is an insight
Into my life
This is a strange flight
I'm taking
My true will
Carries me along
This is a soul dance
Embracing me
This is the first chance
To put things right
Moving on
Guided by the light
And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns
Wisdom of ages
Rush over me
Heighten my senses
Enlighten me
Lead me on
Eternally
And the spirit of love
Is rising within me
Talking to you now
Telling you clearly
The fire still burns
I'm talking to you now
The fire still burns
Whatever you do now
You've got to give love
The world still turns
I'm talking to you now"
It Doesn't Matter	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/it_doesnt_matter-lyrics-46456.html	Album: Black Celebration	"As I lay here with you
The shame lies with us
We talk of love and trust
That doesn't matter
Though we may be the last in the world
We feel like pioneers
Telling hopes and fears
To one another
And oh what a feeling
Inside of me
It might last for an hour
Wounds aren't healing
Inside of me
Though it feels good now
I know it's only for now
The feeling is intense
You grip me with your eyes
And then I realise
It doesn't matter"

And it's called a heart
You know how easy it is
To tear it apart
If I lend it to you
Will you keep it safe for me
I'll lend it to you
If you treat it tenderly
There's something beating here inside my body
And it's called a heart
There's a sun shining in the sky
But that's not the reason why
I'm feeling warm inside
The answer isn't classified, it's my heart
From the moment I started
I tried to be goodhearted
Yes I tried my best
And more or less
I spoke from my heart
There's a lot to be learnt
And you learn when you heart gets burnt
Hearts could never be owned
Hearts only come on loan
If I want it back
I will take it back, I'll take my heart
But I will try my best and more or less
I will speak from my heart
Yes I will speak from my heart
Speak from my heart"

Jezebel	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/jezebel-lyrics-1306090.html	Album: Sounds Of The Universe	"They call you Jezebel
Whenever we walk in
You're going straight to hell
For wanted acts of sin - they say,
And that I'll have to pay
But I need you just this way
They call you Jezebel
For what you like to wear
You're morally unwell
They say you never care for me
But what the fail to see is that your games are the key
Open their eyes to the beauty
Open their hearts to the fun
Open their minds to the idea that you don't own someone
They call you Jezebel
Whenever men walk by
They say that they can tell
The longing in your eyes is real
And how you really feel
But they can't see your appeal
Jezebel"
Judas	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/judas-lyrics-46528.html	Album: Ultra	"Is simplicity best
Or simply the easiest
The narrowest path
Is always the holiest
So walk on barefoot for me
Suffer some misery
If you want my love
If you want my love
Man will survive
The harshest conditions
And stay alive
Through difficult decisions
So make up your mind for me
Walk the line for me
If you want my love
If you want my love
Idle talk
And hollow promises
Cheating Judases
Doubting Thomases
Don't just stand there and shout it
Do something about it
You can fulfill
Your wildest ambitions
And I'm sure you will
Lose your inhibitions
So open yourself for me
Risk your health for me
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my love
If you want my love"

And everything you said

We slip and slide as we fall in love
And I just can't seem to get enough of
We walk together
We're walking down the street
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Every time I think of you
I know we have to meet
And I just can't get enough
I just can't get enough
It's getting hotter
It's a burning love
And I just can't seem to get enough of
And when it rains
You're shining down for me
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
Just like a rainbow
You know you set me free
And I just can't get enough
And I just can't get enough
You're like an angel
And you give me your love
And I just can't seem to get enough of"

We live in a greedy little world--
that teaches every little boy and girl
To earn as much as they can possibly--
then turn around and
Spend it foolishly
We've created us a credit card mess
We spend the money we don't possess
Our religion is to go and blow it all
So it's shoppin' every Sunday at the mall
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store
[Chorus:]
Can you hear it ring
It makes you wanna sing
It's such a beautiful thing--Ka-ching!
Lots of diamond rings
The happiness it brings
You'll live like a king
With lots of money and things
When you're broke go and get a loan
Take out another mortgage on your home
Consolidate so you can afford
To go and spend some more when
you get bored
All we ever want is more
A lot more than we had before
So take me to the nearest store
[Repeat Chorus]
Let's swing
Dig deeper in your pocket
Oh, yeah, ha
Come on I know you've got it
Dig deeper in your wallet
Oh

A lot more than we had before

Leave In Silence	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/leave_in_silence-lyrics-46419.html	Album: The Singles 81>85	"I've told myself so many times before
But this time I think I mean it for sure
We have reached a full stop
Nothing's going to save us from the big drop
Reached our natural conclusion
Outlived the illusion
I hate being in these situations
That call for diplomatic relations
If I only knew the answer
Or I thought we had a chance
Or I could stop this
I would stop this thing
From spreading like a cancer
What can I say
I don't want to play anymore
What can I say
I'm heading for the door
I can't stand this emotional violence
Leave in silence
Leave in silence
We've been running around in circles all year
Doing this and that and getting nowhere
This will be the last time
I think I said that last time
If I only had a potion
Some magical lotion
That could stop this
I would set the wheels in motion"
Lie To Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/lie_to_me-lyrics-46462.html	Album: Black Celebration	"Come on and lay with me
Come on and lie to me
Tell me you love me
Say I'm the only one
Experiences have a lasting impression
But words once spoken
Don't mean a lot now
Belief is the way
The way of the innocent
And when I say innocent
I should say naive
So lie to me
But do it with sincerity
Make me listen
Just for a minute
Make me think
There's some truth in it
Promises made for convenience
Aren't necessarily
What we need
Truth is a word
That's lost its meaning
The truth has become
Merely half-truth
So lie to me
Like they do it in the factory
Make me think
That at the end of the day
Some great reward
Will be coming my way"

Understand, there's a fire to ignite
You know we have a responsibility
It's true we've been chosen
And now we have the possibility
Of melting what's frozen
Walk with me with the rapture inside
Can't you see it's not our place to decide
You know we have to make a case for love
It's more of a duty
It's clear we have a mission from above
A mission of beauty
You know I wouldn't lie to you
What would I achieve by that
It's more than I would try to do
These are the facts
Take your place here
With love in your heart
Just embrace what you've known from the start
We are fulfilling our only destiny
The angels have spoken
And all the gods in the universe agree
The spell can't be broken"

You help her forget
The world outside
You're not part of it yet
And if you could drive
You could drive her away
To a happier place
To a happier day
That exists in your mind
And in your smile
She could escape there
Just for a while
Little fifteen
Little fifteen
Why take the smooth with the rough
When things run smooth
It's already more than enough
She knows your mind
Is not yet in league
With the rest of the world
And its little intrigues
Do you understand
Do you know what she means
As time goes by
And when you've seen what she's seen
you will
Little fifteen
Little fifteen
Why does she have to defend
Her feelings inside
Why pretend
She's not had a life
A life of near misses
Now all that she wants
Is three little wishes
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while
She wants to see with your eyes
She wants to smile with your smile
She wants a nice surprise
Every once in a while

I'm channeling the universe
It's focusing its love inside of me
A Singularity
My little words
Are going to sting
Haven't you heard
The pain and joy they bring
My little soul
Will leave a footprint

That most of the time

In itself
Consequently
I've a tendency
To be unhappy, you see

This play between the sheets
With you on top and me underneath
Forget all about equality
Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant
It's a lot like life
And that's what's appealing
If you despise that throwaway feeling
From disposable fun
Then this is the one
Domination's the name of the game
In bed or in life
They're both just the same
Except in one you're fulfilled
At the end of the day
Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant
Let's play master and servant
Come on master and servant"

The way I'm healed
The pleasure I feel

With the mercy in you
I would do it all again
Lose my way and fall again
Just so I could call again
On the mercy in you
When here in my mind
I feel inclined
To wrongly treat you unkind
I have faith I will find
The mercy in you
I would lose my way again
Be led hopelessly astray again
Just so I could pray again
For the mercy in you
When here in my mind
I have been blind
Emotionally behind
I have faith I will find

Withdrawn but alive

We all have our needs

Don't build at night
You need a little light
How else are you going to see
What it is going to be like
So we picked up our tools
And we worked in the morning light
With the last stone placed
Wasn't it a wonderful site
But it fell back down
And scattered all around
Anything passes

Work all of my days for this kind of praise

My secret garden's not so secret anymore!
No, my secret garden's not so secret anymore!
Run through the fields, down to the edge of the water
Can't stay long, here comes the reason why -
She'll catch me if she can,
Take me by the hand
I'll have to keep on running
And I just can't see the fun in
My secret garden not being secret anymore!
It used to be so easy
On days such as these she'd
Search and search for hours
In among the flowers
I loved it! - I loved her!
Play the fool, act so cruel - I loved it!
Read her book, take a look - I loved her!

I'll admit I was unfaithful
But from now I'll be more faithful
Never turn your back on mother
Never turn your back on mother
Never turn your back on mother earth"
New Dress	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/new_dress-lyrics-46465.html	Album: Music For The Masses	"Sex jibe husband murders wife
Bomb blast victim fights for life
Girl Thirteen attacked with knife
Princess Di is wearing a new dress
Jet airliner shot from sky
Famine horror, millions die
Earthquake terror figures rise
Princess Di is wearing a new dress
You can't change the world
But you can change the facts
And when you change the facts
You change points of view
If you change points of view
You may change a vote
And when you change a vote
You may change the world
In black townships fires blaze
Prospects better premier says
Within sight are golden days
Princess Di is wearing a new dress
You can't change the world
But you can change the facts
And when you change the facts
You change points of view
If you change points of view
You may change a vote
And when you change a vote
You may change the world
Princess Di is wearing a new dress"
New Life	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/new_life-lyrics-46402.html	Album: The Singles 81>85	"I stand still stepping on the shady streets
And I watched that man to a stranger
You think you only know me when you turn on the light
Now the room is lit, red danger
Complicating, circulating
New life, new life
Operating, generating
New life, new life
Transitions to another place
So the time will pass more slowly
Features fuse and your shadow's red
Like a film I've seen now show me
Your face is hidden and were out of sight
And the road just leads to nowhere
The stranger in the door is the same as before
So the question answers nowhere
I stand still stepping on the shady streets
And I watched that man to a stranger
You think you only know me when you turn on the light
Now the room is lit, red danger"
Nodisco	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/nodisco-lyrics-46396.html	Album: Construction Time Again	"I saw you in the picture

You take this too far
This ain't nodisco
Sometimes when I wonder if you're taking a chance
This ain't nodisco and you know how to dance
Move me disco, baby don't you let go
This ain't nodisco
Part one act one
Everyone pretend
This ain't nodisco
This is more a story
And we're reaching the end
This ain't nodisco
Always makes me happy when you're taking a chance
This ain't nodisco and you know how to dance
Move me disco, baby don't you let go
This ain't nodisco
I saw you in the picture
I saw you play the part

You take this too far

Nothing	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/nothing-lyrics-46486.html	Album: Violator	"Sitting target
Sitting waiting

And as you see
There's something to say
Feel the clouds that are not essential
It is re-endless

But neverless, is all I could say
We can see the

We'll be ignorant
Or disobedient
And never say that
This is real fun

That I find myself
I find myself
Something beautiful is happening inside for me
Something sensual, it's full of fire and mystery
I feel hypnotised
I feel paralysed
I have found heaven
There's a thousand reasons
Why I shouldn't spend my time with you
For every reason not to be here
I can think of two
To keep me hanging on
Feeling nothing's wrong
Inside your heaven
It's only when I lose myself in someone else
That I find myself
I find myself
I can feel the emptiness inside me
Fade and disappear
There's a feeling of contentment
Now that you are here
I feel satisfied
I belong inside
Your velvet heaven
Did I need to sell my soul for pleasure like this
Did I have to lose control to treasure your kiss
Did I need to place my heart in the palm of your hand
Before I could even start to understand
It's only when I lose myself in someone else
That I find myself
I find myself"
Peace	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/peace-lyrics-1306086.html	Album: Sounds Of The Universe	"Peace will come to me

This time I'm cleaning up my mind
There is no space for the regrets
I will remember to forget
Just look at me
I am walking love incarnate
Look at the frequencies of which I vibrate
I'm going to light up the world
Peace will come to me
Peace will come to me
I'm leaving anger in the past
With all the shadows that it cast
There is radar in my heart
I should have trusted from the start
Just look at me
I am a living act of holiness
Giving all the positive virtues that I possess
I'm going to light up the world
Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me
It's meant to be
Peace will come to me
Just wait and see
Peace will come to me

So why should it be
You and I should get along so awfully
So we're different colours
And we're different creeds
And different people have different needs
It's obvious you hate me
Though I've done nothing wrong
I've never even met you so what could I have done
I can't understand
What makes a man
Hate another man
Help me understand
Help me understand
Now you're punching
And you're kicking
And you're shouting at me
I'm relying on your common decency
So far it hasn't surfaced
But I'm sure it exists
It just takes a while to travel
From your head to your fists"
Perfect	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/perfect-lyrics-1306088.html	Album: Sounds Of The Universe	"On another world by another star at another place and time
In another state of consciousness in another state of mind
Everything was almost perfect, everything fell into place,
That you may reach a different verdict,
If all the judges missed the case
In a parallel universe that's happening right now
Things between us must be worse but it's hard to see just how
And everything could have been perfect
Everything in the right place
Then I wouldn't have to play the suspect
Accused, abandoned and disgraced
I didn't choose, i didn't pull the trigger
It wasn't me, i'm just a plain and simple singer
I heard the sound, i turned my head around
To watch our love shot down
In another lonely universe, we're laying side by side
Well no-ones hurt and no-ones cursed and no one needs to hide
And everything is almost perfect
Everything is almost right
There are never any conflicts
There are never any fights"

Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there
Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver
Reach out and touch faith
Reach out and touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus

Lights on, switch on
Your eyes are far away
The map represents you
And the tape is your voice
Follow all along you
Till you recognize the choice
I take pictures, photographic pictures
Bright light, dark room
Bright light, dark room
I said I'd write a letter
But I never got the time
And I'm looking to the day
I mesmerize at night
The years I spent just thinking
Of a moment we both knew
A second past like in empty room
It seems it can't be true

Construction time again
What is it this time
We're laying a pipeline
Let the beads of sweat flow
Until the ends have met through
Could take a long time
Working on the pipeline
Taking from the greedy
Giving to the needy
On this golden day
Work's been sent our way
That could last a lifetime
Working on the pipeline
From the heart of our land
To the mouth of the man
Must reach him sometime

If you're looking for a reason I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure
Everybody's looking for a new sensation
Everybody's talking about the state of the nation
Everybody's searching for a promised land
Everybody's failing to understand
Pleasure, little treasure
Everybody's looking for a reason to live
If you're looking for a reason
I've a reason to give
Pleasure, little treasure
Maternity frocks and paternity suits
If that's what you want
They're waiting for you
Everybody needs some reason or other
You'll find a reason when you discover

Policy Of Truth	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/policy_of_truth-lyrics-46509.html	Album: The Singles 86>98	"I've read more than a hundred books
Seeing love mentioned many thousand times
But despite all the places I've looked
It's still no clearer
It's just not enough
I'm still no clearer
The meaning of love
Noted down all my observations
Spent an evening watching television
Still I couldn't say with precision
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above
But what's the meaning
The meaning of love
(Tell me)
From the notes that I've made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
But I could be wrong
I'm just not sure you see
I'm never been in love before
Next I asked several friends of mine
If they could spare a few minutes of their time
Their looks suggested that I've lost my mind
Tell me the answer
My Lord high above
Tell me the meaning
The meaning of love
From the notes that I've made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
But I could be wrong
I'm just not sure you see
I'm never been in love before
The meaning of love
(Tell me)
Tell me the meaning of love."

Need special handling
My God what have we done to you
We always tried to share
The tenderest of care
Now look what we have put you through
Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give
Angels with silver wings
Shouldn't know suffering
I wish I could take the pain for you
If God has a master plan
That only He understands
I hope it's your eyes He's seeing through
Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give
I pray you learn to trustHave faith in both of us
And keep room in your hearts for two
Things get damaged
Things get broken
I thought we'd manage
But words left unspoken
Left us so brittle
There was so little left to give"

I can move you
I can soothe you
I can take you places in a different way
I don't think you understand
What I'm trying to say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control
Watch your action
Close reaction
And everything you're thinking babe inside your head
Conversation, my creation
Nothing that you do
You do unless I said
You don't know the consequences
Of the things you say
I'll be your operator baby
I'm in control
All the things you tried to do babe
And all the words we said before
Are only part of what I started baby
And you can't stop me anymore"

No more reason, see the cloud
As I watch you from the road
Find it open, Reason Man

Moving in there's nothing to see
One look and you'll always regret
Thinking someone ought to hear
If you listen and only fear
Things were edging to the right
See him laughing, Reason Man
See him laughing, Reason Man
Ever infected all the time
Only boredom crime
Blessed with the feeling we will break
Now infecting Reason Man

To conceal me
Open your sensitive mouth
Hold out your delicate hands
With such a sensitive mouth
I'm easy to see through
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for you
Cry for you
Seen the tears
Roll down from my eyes for you
Heard my truth
Distorting to lies for you
Watched my love
Becoming a prize for you
Seen the tears in my eyes
Heard my truth turn to lies
Seen the tears in my eyes
I'm not proud of what I do
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for you
I come up to meet you
Up there somewhere
When I rush to greet you
My soul is bared
Gave more for you
Dropped my crutches
And crawled on the floor for you
Went looking behind every door for you
And because of the things
That I saw for you
I spiritually grew
When I come up
When I rush
I rush for you"

I'm a missionary
So here is my confesion
It's an obsession
I'm a firm believer
And a warm receiver
And I've made my decision
This is religion
There's no doubt
I'm one of the devout
Trying to sell the story
Of love's eternal glory
Spreading the news around the world
Taking the word to boys and girls
I'm a firm believer
And a warm receiver
And I will go down on my knees
When I see beauty
There's no doubt
I'm one of the devout
Trying to sell the story
Of love's eternal glory

I'll never be the same again
Going to lock myself in a cold black room
Going to shadow myself in a veil of gloom
I will function, operate
I will be a satellite of hate
Driven to this point by a chain of events
Each one pushed me nearer the edge
Going to send my message through to you
You'll receive the signal too
I will function, operate
I will be a satellite of hate
Higher, Higher
Disillusioned - I was disenchanted
Forgot the love that had been implanted
Heard the lies and I felt the cold
It broke my heart and I lost control
Now I'm a satellite of a free state
I'm a satellite of hate"

But I don't care
Sea of sin
Through thick and thin
For better or worse
My mind's in need
So my body feeds
And it quenches my thirst
You look cheaper and cheaper
As we sink deeper and deeper
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
'Cause I've been there
Here under God's sky
His watchful eye
And all of the lies
My consolation prize
Sea of sin
My second skin
My home from home
When I'm in doubt
My hands reach out
And I'm never alone
It gets wetter and wetter
As it gets better and better
Sea of sin
Know where you've been
And I'm prepared

Know where you've been
Yes I'm aware

All I want to do is see you
Don't you know that it's true
I remember the days when we walked through the woods
We'd sit on a bench for a while
I treasure the way we used to laugh and play
And look in each others eyes
You can keep me at a distance if you don't trust my resistance
But I swear I won't touch you
Well I know five years is a long time and that times change
But I think that you'll find people are basically the same
If the water's still flowing we can go for a swim

And if I'm reluctant you can pull me in
We can relive our youth
But we'll just stay friendly like sister and brother

Begging you to adore me
Can't you see it's misery
And torture for me
When I'm misunderstood
Try as hard as you can
I've tried as hard as I could
To make you see
How important it is for me
Here is a plea
From my heart to you
Nobody knows me
As well as you do
You know how hard it is for me
To shake the disease
That takes hold of my tongue
In situations like these
Understand me
Some people have to be
Permanently together
Lovers devoted
To each other forever
Now I've got things to do
And I've said before
That I know you have too
When I'm not there
In spirit I'll be there"

When the guilt begins to hurt
Seeing all the children
Wallowing in dirt
Crying out with hunger
Crying out in pain
At least the dirt will wash off
When it starts to rain
Soap won't wash away your shame
Do you ever get that feeling
That something isn't right
Seeing your brother's fists
Clenched ready for the fight
Soon the fighting turns to weapons
And the weapons turn to wounds
So the doctors stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch
Surgery won't improve your pain
It all seems so stupid
It makes me want to give up
But why should I give up
When it all seems so stupid
Do you ever get the feeling
That something can be done
To eradicate these problems
And make the people one
Do you ever get that feeling
Something like a nagging itch
And all the while the doctors
Stitch and stitch and stitch
And stitch and stitch
Hope alone won't remove the stains
Shame"

Can change the course of history
Remember that
Mummy's annoyed, says go and play
Don't show your face
Stay away all day
Shouldn't have done that
A small boy and his infantry
Marching around so naturally
Shouldn't have done that
Grows up and goes to school
Such a nice boy
Obeys all the rules
Mummy's proud of that
Leaves school to follow his ambition
Knows what he wants
To be a politician
Shouldn't have done that!"

I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand
Carefully watching waiting as I
Stood upon the back streets and we start to play
I was screaming louder as the
Curtains fall between us in a twisted way
Staring in the night
A picture in my room
And I think that she knew her lines
Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand
We've got to get it right
We've got to understand
Placing all the questions in the
Minutes of a game we won so long ago
Dangerous and beautiful the
Radio transmission that I have to know
You could never run
You could never stay
And I think you belong to me
Break away tonight
I wanna hold your hand

We've got to understand"

When the hunger descends
And your body's a fire
An inferno that never ends
An eternal flame
That burns in desire's name
Sister of night
When the longing returns
Giving voice to the flame
Calling you through flesh that burns
Breaking down your will
To move in for the kill
Oh sister
Come for me
Embrace me
Assure me
Hey sister
I feel it too
Sweet sister
Just feel me
I'm trembling
You heal me
Hey sister
I feel it too
Sister of night
In your saddest dress
As you walk through the light
You're desperate to impress
So you slide to the floor
Feeling insecure
Sister of night
With the loneliest eyes
Tell yourself it's alright
He'll make such a perfect prize
But the cold light of day
Will give the game away
Oh sister
Come for me
Embrace me
Assure me
Hey sister
I feel it too
Sweet sister
Just feel me
I'm trembling
You heal me

Smile In The Crowd	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/smile_in_the_crowd-lyrics-440721.html	Album: Speak Spell	"You turned me away
Away from your actions
Forced by the violence
That always surrounds you
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
You burnt yourself out
In that silence
I have to tell you
I ache for you still
The sound of my words
Is always so shocking
They get much louder
Each time I speak
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
Signals of progress
We're growing much older
I'm afraid that I'll leave
And my ache never goes
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd
I want your special smile
A smile in this crowd"
Somebody	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/somebody-lyrics-46451.html	Album: The Singles 81>85	"I want somebody to share
Share the rest of my life
Share my innermost thoughts
Know my intimate details
Someone who'll stand by my side
And give me support
And in return
She'll get my support
She will listen to me
When I want to speak
About the world we live in
And life in general
Though my views may be wrong
They may even be perverted
She will hear me out
And won't easily be converted
To my way of thinking
In fact she'll often disagree
But at the end of it all
She will understand me
I want somebody who cares
For me passionately
With every thought and with every breath
Someone who'll help me see things
In a different light
All the things I detest
I will almost like
I don't want to be tied
To anyone's strings
I'm carefully trying to steer clear
Of those things
But when I'm asleep
I want somebody
Who will put their arms around me
And kiss me tenderly
Though things like this
Make me sick
In a case like this
I'll get away with it"
Something To Do	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/something_to_do-lyrics-46463.html	Album: Violator	"My little girl
Won't you come with me
Come with me
Tell me
Is there something to do
I'm going crazy with boredom
Come with me
Tell me
Grey sky over a black town
I can feel depression
All around
You've got your leather boots on
I can't stand another drink
It's surprising this town
Doesn't sink
You've got your leather boots on
Your pretty dress is oil stained
From working too hard
For too little
You've got your leather boots on
You're feeling the boredom too
I'd gladly go with you
I'd put your leather boots on
I'd put your pretty dress on"
Sometimes	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/sometimes-lyrics-46477.html	Album: Music For The Masses	"Sometimes
Only sometimes
I question everything
And I'm the first to admit
If you catch me in a mood like this
I can be tiring
Even embarassing
But you must
Feel the same
When you look around
You can't tell me honestly
You're happy with what you see
Oh sometimes
Only sometimes
You must be...
You must be...
As embarassing as me
Sometimes"
Stories Of Old	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/stories_of_old-lyrics-46455.html	Album: Black Celebration	"Take a look at unselected cases
You'll find love has been wrecked
By both sides compromising
Amounting to a disastrous effect
You hear stories of old
Of princes bold
With riches untold
Happy souls
Casting it all aside
To take some bride
To have the girl of their dreams
At their side
But not me
I couldn't do that
Not me
I'm not like that
I couldn't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love
I really like you
I'm attracted to you
The way you move
The things you do
I'll probably burn in hell
For saying this
But I'm really in heaven
Whenever we kiss
But Oh no!
You won't change me
You can try
For an eternity
I wouldn't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love
Now I've got things to do
You have too
And I've got to be me
You've got to be you
So take my hand
And feel these lips
And let's savour a kiss
Like we'd savour a sip
Of vintage wine
One more time
Let's surrender
To this love divine
But we won't sacrifice
Anything at all
To love"
Strangelove	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/strangelove-lyrics-46497.html	Album: The Singles 86>98	"There'll be times
When my crimes
Will seem almost unforgivable
I give in to sin
Because you have to make this life livable
But when you think I've had enough
From your sea of love
I'll take more than another riverful
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile
Strangelove
Strange highs and strange lows
Strangelove
That's how my love goes
Strangelove
Will you give it to me
Will you take the pain
I will give to you
Again and again
And will you return it
There'll be days
When I stray
I may appear to be
Constantly out of reach
I give in to sin
Because I like to practice what I preach
I'm not trying to say
I'll have it all my way
I'm always willing to learn
When you've got something to teach
And I'll make it all worthwhile
I'll make your heart smile
Pain will you return it
I'll say it again - pain
Pain will you return it
I won't say it again
I give in
Again and again
I give in
Will you give it to be
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in
I give in
Again and again
I give in
That's how my love goes
I give in
I'll say it again
I give in"
Stripped	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/stripped-lyrics-46469.html	Album: The Singles 86>98	"Come with me
Into the trees
We'll lay on the grass
And let the hours pass
Take my hand
Come back to the land
Let's get away
Just for one day
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Metropolis
Has nothing on this
You're breathing in fumes
I taste when we kiss
Take my hand
Come back to the land
Where everything's ours
For a few hours
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you
Make decisions
Without your television
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you speaking
Just for me
Let me see you
Stripped down to the bone
Let me hear you crying
Just for me"
Surrender	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/surrender-lyrics-46373.html	Album: A Broken Frame	"Laying on your holy bed
by the hallowed door
Feeling like an infidel
Not worthy of your call
Tempted by your innocence
Beckoned to my fate
I won't face the consequence
I wouldn't hesitate
I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture
Rushing through my veins
Passion
Flaming
In my heart
Heavenly surrender once again
Yeah
Shackled like an animal
Chained to my desires
Just another sacrifice
To love's eternal fight
Tame me with your tenderness
And break my brittle heart
Easily and elegantly
Tear my world apart
I'm a man of flesh and bone
Rapture
Rushing through my veins
Passion
Flaming
In my heart
Heavenly surrender once again
Yeah
We're living in a world full of illusion
Everything is so unreal
My mind is in a state of confusion
But I can't deny the way I feel
I'm a man of flesh and bone

Rushing through my veins
Yeah"

Know what comes next
Seen it before
And it's painful
Things must change
We must rearrange them
Or we'll have to estrange them
All that I'm saying
A game's not worth playing
Over and over again
You're the one I like best
You retain my interest
You're the only one
If it wasn't for you
Don't know what I'd do
Unpredictable like the sun

Sometimes I feel I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
From the pain that you drive into the heart of me
The love we share
Seems to go nowhere
And I've lost my light
For I toss and turn I can't sleep at night
Chorus
Once I ran to you (I ran)
Now I'll run from you
This tainted love you've given
I give you all a boy could give you
Take my tears and that's not nearly all
Oh...tainted love
Tainted love
Now I know I've got to
Run away I've got to
Get away
You don't really want any more from me
To make things right
You need someone to hold you tight
And you think love is to pray
But I'm sorry I don't pray that way
Repeat chorus
Don't touch me please
I cannot stand the way you tease
I love you though you hurt me so
Now I'm going to pack my things and go
Tainted love, tainted love (x2)
Touch me baby, tainted love (x2)
Tainted love (x3)"

Changing for modern times

I'm just a television set
I'm just a television set
Well you can have me in bed if you want me
Just plug me into your wall
And I'll give you sex if you want it
Or I'll give you nothing at all
You can have me, babe, for good times
You can have me, babe, for bad
Keep me running all of your life and
I'll return your instant demand
I'm just a television set
I'm just a television set
I'm just a television set

Dragged in from the rain
Who goes straight back out
To do it all over again
I'll be back for more
It's something
That is out of our hands
Something we will never understand
It's a hidden law
The apple falls
Destiny calls
I follow you
Like a pawn
On the eternal board
Who's never quite sure
What he's moved towards
I walk blindly on
And heaven is in front of me
Your heaven beckons me enticingly
When I arrive
It's gone
The river flows
The wise man knows
I follow you
I'm yearning
I'm burning
I feel love's wheels turning
Like a moth on love's bright light
I will get burned
each and every night
I'm dying to(o)
The sun will shine
The bottom line
I follow you"

To our sleaziest worlds
With our lecherous plans
In our treacherous hands
You'd be wasting your time
Saying no, it's a crime
All that we live for you'll regret
All you remember we'll forget
We are the dead of night
We're in the zombie room
We're twilight's parasites
With self-inflicted wounds
We are the dead of night
We're in the zombie room
Heavenly oversights
Eating from silver spoons
With our decadent minds
And our innocent lines
You'll be playing our games
With your bodies in flames
When delirious fun
Has seriously begun
You'll be down on your knees
You'll be begging us please
All we're demanding you'll supply
All we're accused of we'll deny
We are the dead of night
We're in the zombie room
We're twilight's parasites
With self-inflicted wounds
We are the dead of night
We're in the zombie room
Heavenly oversights
Eating from silver spoons

The Landscape Is Changing	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/the_landscape_is_changing-lyrics-46425.html	Album: Some Great Reward	"The landscape is changing
The landscape is crying
Thousands of acres of forest are dying
Carbon copies from the hills above the forest line
Acid streams are flowing ill across the countryside
'Cause I don't care if you're going nowhere
Just take good care of the world
I don't case if you're going nowhere
Just take good care of the world
Now we're re-arranging
There's no use denying
Mountains and valleys, can't you hear them sighing
Evolution, the solution or the certainty
Can you imagine this intrusion of their privacy
Token gestures, some semblance of intelligence
Can we be blamed for the security of ignorance"
The Love Thieves	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/the_love_thieves-lyrics-46547.html	Album: Disc 1	"Oh the tears that you weep
for the poor tortured souls
who fall at your feet
with their love begging bowls
all the clerks and the tailors
the sharks and the sailors
all good at the trades
but they'll always be failures
Alms for the poor
for the wretched disciples
and the love that they swore
with their hearts on the bible
beseeching the honour
to sit at your table
and feast on your holiness
as long as they're able
Love needs its martyrs
needs its sacrifices
they live for your beauty
and pay for their vices
love will be the death of
my lonely soul brothers
but their spirit shall live on in
the hearts of all lovers
You're holding court
with your lips and your smile
your body's a halo
their minds are on trial
sure as adam is eve
sure as jonah turned whaler
they're crooked love thieves
and you are their jailor
Love needs its martyrs
needs its sacrifices
they live for your beauty
and pay for their vices
love will be the death of
my lonely soul brothers
but their spirit shall live on in
the hearts of all lovers."
The Meaning Of Love	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/the_meaning_of_love-lyrics-46409.html	Album: The Singles 81>85	"I've read more than a hundred books
Seeing love mentioned many thousand times
But despite all the places I've looked
It's still no clearer
I'm still no nearer
The meaning of love
Noted down all my observations
Spent an evening watching television
Still I couldn't say with precision
Know it's a feeling and it comes from above
But what's the meaning
The meaning of love
(tell me)
From the notes that I've made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
Well I could be wrong
I'm just not sure you see
I've never been in love before
Next I asked several friends of mine
If they could spare a few minutes of their time
Their looks suggested that I've lost my mind
Tell me the answer
My Lord high above
Tell me the meaning
The meaning of love
From the notes that I've made so far
Love seems something like wanting a scar
Well I could be wrong
I'm just not sure you see
I've never been in love before
The meaning of love
(tell me)
Tell me the meaning of love

Drink all you can but you won't forget her
You talk too much, you laugh too loud
You see her face in every crowd
That's the price of love, the price of love
A debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
It costs you more when you're to blame
Kiss one girl, kiss another
Kiss them all but you won't recover
You're dancing slow, you're dancing fast
You're happy now, but that won't last
That's the price of love, the price of love
A debt you pay with tears and pain
The price of love, the price of love
It costs you more when you're to blame"

God help me
Is all it took
To sell me
One single word
Unspoken
Your name unheard
And I'm broken
The sun and the moon
and the stars in the sky
Are laughing
They've seen it all before
For the wind in the trees
and the waves on the seas
It's the same thing
They can't take any more
One gentle touch
and I'm helpless
It's all too much
For my senses
One simple prayer
Denied me
When you're not there
Beside me
The sun and the moon
and the stars in the sky
Are laughing
They've seen it all before
For the wind in the trees

They can't take any more"

Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
Wandering around in silent wonder
What chance did I have
With the silver moon
Hanging in the sky
Opening old wounds
Taking hold of the hem of your dress
Cleanliness only comes in small doses
Bodily whole but my head's in a mess
Fuelling obsession that borders psychosis
It's a sad disease
Creeping through my mind
Causing disabilities
Of the strangest kind
Getting lost in the folds of your skirt
There's a price that I pay for my mission
A body in heaven and a mind full of dirt
How I suffer the sweetest condition
Taken in by the delicate noise
Knocked to the ground by the subtle thunder
Shackled and bound by the sound of your voice
Wandering around in silent wonder"

You brought me down to earth

For all of the fun
The damage is done
And I feel diseased
I'm down on my knees
And I need forgiveness
Someone to bear witness
To the goodness within
Beneath the sin
Although I may flirt
With all kinds of dirt
To the point of disease
Now I want release
From all this decay
Take it away
And somewhere
There's someone who cares
With a heart of gold
To have and to hold"

And walk upon their brothers
While their heads are busy lying low
Trying to keep to cover...oh
Something went wrong
Along the way
Everybody's waiting for
Judgment day
So they can go
Told you so
Bring me my gun of itching desire
Bring me my bullets and I will fire
Sights set higher than the tall church spire
Standing in line
The blind lead the blind
Waiting and waiting
For an overdue sign
Brothers and sisters
Playing Chinese whispers
If things aren't suited
Then they'll get diluted
There's one more dead with a hole in his head
He shouldn't have said all the things he said
Many tears were shed for the blood he bled"

You dance with pride and you dance with pride
Ice cold drinks, get sold tonight
We're gonna get happy, the occasion is right
You start to move, you take the floor
The music is better than ever before
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance
You dance your dance, you dance your chance
Tomorrow's dance, tomorrow's dance
You dance with pride and you dance with pride

I had a nightmare only yesterday
You played a skeleton
You took my love then died that day
I played an American

Scattered to the highest high
Expect they'll either laugh or cry
No sex, no consequence, no sympathy
You're good enough to heat

Two minutes later
When time has come
My days are numbered
The dawning of another year
Marks time for those who understand
One in four still here
While you and I go hand in hand
No radio, no sound, no sin, no sanctuary
So welcome to your last
The sun, the solitude, the cemetary
So welcome to your last"

All my hanging around
All your cutting down to size
All my bringing you down
Watch the clock on the wall
Feel the slowing of time
Hear a voice in the hall
Echoing in my mind
All your stupid ideals
You've got your head in the clouds
You should see how it feels
With your feet on the ground
Here I stand the accused
With your fist in my face
Feeling tired and bruised
With the bitterest taste
All my useless advice
All my hanging around
All your cutting down to size
All my bringing you down
All your stupid ideals
You've got your head in the clouds

When everything's dark
Keeps us from the stark reality
I'm waiting for the night to fall
When everything is bearable
And there in the still
All that you feel
Is tranquility
There is a star in the sky
Guiding my way with its light
And in the glow of the moon
Know my deliverance will come soon
There is a sound in the calm
Someone is coming to harm
I press my hands to my ears
It's easier here just to forget fear
And when I squinted
The world seemed rose-tinted
And angels appeared to descend
To my surprise
With half-closed eyes
Things looked even better
Than when they were opened
Been waiting for the night to fall
Now everything is bearable
And here in the still
All that you hear
Is tranquility"

The pain I've been subjected to
But the Lord himself would blush
The countless feasts laid at my feet
Forbidden fruits for me to eat
But I think your pulse would start to rush
Now I'm not looking for absolution
Forgiveness for the things I do
But before you come to any conclusions
Try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
You'll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes
Morality would frown upon
Decency look down upon
The scapegoat fate's made of me
But I promise now, my judge and jurors
My intentions couldn't have been purer
My case is easy to see
I'm not looking for a clearer conscience
Peace of mind after what I've been through
And before we talk of any repentance
Try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
You'll stumble in my footsteps
Keep the same appointments I kept
If you try walking in my shoes
If you try walking in my shoes
Try walking in my shoes
Now I'm not looking for absolution
Forgiveness for the things I do

The countless feasts laid at my feet,
Forbidden fruits for me to eat.
But I think your pulse would start to rush.
Now I'm not looking for absolution,
Forgiveness for the things I do.
But before you come to any conclusions -
Try walking in my shoes,
Try walking in my shoes.
You'll stumble in my footsteps,
Keep the same appointments I kept.
If you try walking in my shoes.
If you try walking in my shoes.
Morality would frown upon,
Decency look down upon.
The scapegoat fate's made of me.
But I promise now, my judge and jurors,
My intentions couldn't have been purer.
My case is easy to see.
I'm not looking for a clearer conscience,
Peace of mind after what I've been through.
And before we talk of any repentance -
Try walking in my shoes.
Try walking in my shoes.
You'll stumble in my footsteps,
Keep the same appointments I kept.
If you try walking in my shoes.
If you try walking in my shoes.
Try walking in my shoes.
Now I'm not looking for absolution,
Forgiveness for the things I do.
But before you come to any conclusions -
Try walking in my shoes.
Try walking in my shoes.
You'll stumble in my footsteps,
Keep the same appointments I kept.
If you try walking in my shoes.
Try walking in my shoes.
If you try walking in my shoes.
Try walking in my shoes."
When The Body Speaks	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/when_the_body_speaks-lyrics-33724.html	Album: Exciter	"To the soul's desires
The body listens
What the flesh requires
Keeps the heart imprisoned
What the spirit seeks
The mind will follow
When the body speaks
All else is hollow
I'm just an angel
Driving blindly
Through this world
I'm just a slave here
At the mercy
Of a girl
Oh I need your tenderness
Oh I need your touch
Oh I dream of one caress
Oh I pray too much
To the soul's desires
The body listens
What the flesh requires
Keeps the heart imprisoned
What the spirit seeks
The mind will follow
When the body speaks
All else is hollow
You keep me waiting
For the promise
That is mine
Please stop debating
Please stop wasting
Your time
Oh I need your tenderness
Oh I need your touch
Oh I dream of one caress
Oh I pray too much"
Work Hard	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/work_hard-lyrics-46361.html	Album: Catching Up With Depeche Mode	"You've got to work hard
You've got to work hard
If you want anything at all
Nothing comes easy
And that's a fact
Nothing comes easy
But a broken back
Nothing comes easy
It never will
Nothing comes easy
But a broken will
So work hard"
World Full Of Nothing	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/world_full_of_nothing-lyrics-46467.html	Album: Music For The Masses	"Close
Naked
Skin on skin
Tears are falling
Tears of joy
Her first boy
His first girl
Makes a change
In a world full of nothing
Though it's not love
It means something
She's lonely
And he says
It's for her only
That he lusts
She doesn't trust him
Nothing is true
But he will do
In a world full of nothing
Though it's not love
It means something
It's easy to slip away
And believe it all
Though it's not love
It means something"
World In My Eyes	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/depeche_mode/world_in_my_eyes-lyrics-46519.html	Album: Songs Of Faith And Devotion - Live	"Let me take you on a trip
Around the world and back
And you won't have to move
You just sit still
Now let your mind do the walking
And let my body do the talking
Let me show you the world in my eyes
I'll take you to the highest mountain
To the depths of the deepest sea
And we won't need a map
Believe me
Now let my body do the moving
And let my hands do the soothing
Let me show you the world in my eyes
That's all there is
Nothing more than you can feel now
That's all there is
Let me put you on a ship
On a long, long trip
Your lips close to my lips
All the islands in the ocean
All the heaven's in motion
Let me show you the world in my eyes
That's all there is
Nothing more than you can touch now
That's all there is
Let me show you the world in my eyes"
