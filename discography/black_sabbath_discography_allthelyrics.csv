A Bit Of Finger	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/a_bit_of_finger-lyrics-358933.html	Black Box: The Complete Original Black Sabbath	"I am the crazy man
Who lives inside your head
But I think I'm breaking through the wall
You are the innocent
Convicted of the crime
No one was ever there
To catch you when you fall
I see the diamonds
But you only see the rock
I need to run
But you only crawl
It's time to open up
All the doors that you keep locked
Nobody gives without a take
Let's take it all
You've been twisted into pieces
By the hands of your emotions
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father
One more crucifixion
One more cross to bear
You're a hole in a photograph
Go on - lose it in the city
The city can feel no shame
See the world with electric eye
They call it mystery
But any fool could see
You thought he walked on the water
And if the pain was gone
And you were free to run away
And get out
Would you get out of there
Or do you really care
It's not safe or easy
And maybe when you're gone
You just won't belong at all
You're the only witness
To the murder of an angel
How much longer are you gonna pay
For yesterday
Sins of the father
It's just another crucifixion
One more cross to bear
Go on lose it in the city
Take a look at the world
You've got electric eyes"
A National Acrobat	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/a_national_acrobat-lyrics-7159.html	Sabbath Bloody Sabbath	"I am the world that hides
The universal secret of all time
Destruction of the empty spaces
Is my one and only crime
I've lived a thousand times
I found out what it means to be believed
The thoughts and images
The unborn child that never was conceived
When little worlds collide
I'm trapped inside my embryonic cell
And flashing memories
Are cast into the never ending well
The name that scorns the face
The child that never sees the cause of man
The deathly darkness that
Belies the fate of those who never ran
Well I know its hard for you
To know the reason why
And I know you'll understand
More when it's time to die
Don't believe the life you have
Will be the only one
You have to let your body sleep
To let your soul live on
Love has given life to you
And now it's your concern
Unseen eyes of inner life
Will make your soul return
Still I look but not to touch
The seeds of life are sown
Curtain of the future falls
The secret stays unknown
Just remember love is life
And hate is living death
Treat your life for what it's worth
And live for every breath
Looking back I've lived and learned
But now I'm wondering
Here I wait and only guess
What this next life will bring"

After All (The Dead)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/after_all_the_dead-lyrics-1127781.html	The Dio Years	"What do you say to the dead
Will you forgive me for living
Can't believe the things that they said
Wonderful day for a killing
It's killing me
What do they do with your soul
Is it just lying there busted
When did you lose all control
Is there someone to be trusted
With my mind
Oh there's insufficient evidence
Of what just might come after
But sometimes out of nowhere
There's demented sounds of laughter
Are we all haunted by
The ghost - imagination
It just can't be
I've seen them there
Howling at the moon
Is it just me
Or does somebody else believe this
Well I'm not alone
And I'm not afraid
There's just one way to see
After all etc.
What do you say to the dead
Is there a place where it's burning
It says in a book I once read
Yes there's a chance of returning
Turn to me
The fundamental principles
Say nothing of forever
But those are voices that I hear
Or I'm just not so clever
It can't be me
I know somebody else believes this
Well I'm not alone
I'm not afraid
Just one way to see
After all etc."
After Forever	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/after_forever-lyrics-32391.html	Master Of Reality	"Have you ever thought about your soul - can it be saved?
Or perhaps you think that when you're dead you just stay in your grave
Is God just a thought within your head or is he a part of you?
Is Christ just a name that you read in a book when you were in school?
When you think about death do you lose your breath or do you keep your cool?
Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope - do you think he's a fool?
Well I have seen the truth, yes I've seen the light and I've changed my ways
And I'll be prepared when you're lonely and scared at the end of our days
Could it be you're afraid of what your friends might say
If they knew you believe in God above?
They should realize before they criticize
that God is the only way to love
Is your mind so small that you have to fall
In with the pack wherever they run
Will you still sneer when death is near
And say they may as well worship the sun?
I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ
I think it is sad the opinion you had was the only one voiced
Will you be so sure when your day is near, say you don't believe?
You had the chance but you turned it down, now you can't retrieve
Perhaps you'll think before you say that God is dead and gone
Open your eyes, just realize that he's the one
The only one who can save you now from all this sin and hate
Or will you still jeer at all you hear? Yes! I think it's too late."
Air Dance	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/air_dance-lyrics-7178.html	Never Say Die	"She sits in silence, in her midnight world
Her faded pictures, of her dancing girls
Her, distant dreamer, on the seas of time
Her happy memories, dancing through her mind
In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away
And as the seasons turn the days to years
She holds her pictures, hears the silent cheers
The days grow lonely for the dancing queen
And now she dances only in her dreams
In days of romance
She was the queen of dance
She'd dance the night away, away, away, away"

And they're saying all moving parts stand still
Since he was elected, adrenalin injected
Hear him saying all moving parts should kill
Just like the hero he's got them all on the run
Yes he's won, yeah
Since he passed the motion
They're building in the ocean
And he's saying all men should all be free
What a combination, peace and radiation
And he's saying free men should fight for me
Just like his momma, he seems to get his pleasure from pain
And the rain, ain't that strange? Very strange, yeah
I like choking toys
You've got to see me before you meet the boys
Teacher's burnt the school
He's had enough of sticking to the rules, alright
People stop and see
He's got to be more decadent than me
Just to pass the time
He gets his kicks from licking off the wine
Pretty silly ladies
All Cynthia's and Sadie's
Call him and he takes their numbers down
Says he is a woman
I should have seen it coming
And she's saying she's married to a clown
Just like a lady she'll keep you guessing through the night
Not tonight, well I might, oh alright, yeah"
Am I Going Insane (Radio)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/am_i_going_insane_radio-lyrics-7155.html	Sabotage	"Everybody's looking at me, feeling paranoid inside
When I step outside I feel free, think I'll find a place to hide
Tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?
Every day I sit and wonder how my life it used to be
Now I feel like going under, now my life is hard to see
So tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?
So I'm telling all you people, listen while I sing again
If I don't sound very cheerful, I think that I'm a schizo brain
So tell me people, am I going insane?
Tell me people, am I going insane?"
Ancient Warrior	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/ancient_warrior-lyrics-104018.html	Eternal Idol	"There's no end - there's no beginning -
To the old man's story
Does he still remember me -
From lives gone by
Oh I see his spirit rising
Upon the back of time
I've got nowhere to hide
Will he keep a place for me
He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings
In his eyes an ocean's burning
Swollen seat of tears
Troubled mind the beating
War drums in his ears
No one ever hears his warning
Am I the one he calls
When they tell me they're afraid
Some say I'll be put away
He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings
My blood will spill my blood
My blood will spill my blood
In the wisdom of the prophet's
Never ending tale
Open up the eyes
Within your mind, he says
Crowned in his ancient glory
There's a king within us all
Some will say it's all in vain
That he doesn't have a name
He is the king of all kings
The keeper of light
He holds eternity's wings"
Angry Heart	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/angry_heart-lyrics-104019.html	Seventh Star	"I still remember how it used to be
I thought the only thing
That mattered was me
You always told me it was just insane
To feel such joy while others feel pain
There's no way to change this angry heart
Cause when love goes it will tear you apart
And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a promised land
And the years slip by like so much sand
So many people who are dying to live
It tortures my heart they've got so much to give
I never saw it as a battle before
To win the fight
There has to be more
And there's no way to change this angry heart
Cause all these fears
Will tear you apart
And it's been this way since time began
It's an endless journey, it's the fate of man
To live each day and never understand
And it's been this way since time began
It's a desperate search for a master plan
And the years slip by like water through your hands"

Back Street Kids	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/back_street_kids-lyrics-7165.html	Technical Ecstasy	"I'm just another back street kid
Rock 'n Roll music is the only thing I really dig
Can't stop the music going round inside my head
I'm a rock 'n roll soldier, gonna play it until I'm dead
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me
Sitting in the back seat of a shiny limousine
Living in a taxi can't remember where I've been
Playing my music, sitting in my hotel room
Writing about the stars and thinking about the hand of doom
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me
Living life comes easy if you know which way you're going
Got to see yourself in other's eye's, surprised?
Living like I want to don't come easy, but I'm trying
Sorting out what's true and what are lies, it's wise
Brought up in a back street living with the salt of the land
Seems that now my music's paying off my tax demands
So listen to the music, want to see you get so high
'Cause I'm a back street rocker and I will be till the day I die
Nobody I know is gonna take my rock 'n roll away from me"

Behind The Wall Of Sleep	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/behind_the_wall_of_sleep-lyrics-32387.html	Black Sabbath	"Precious cups within the flower
deadly petals with strange power
faces shine a deadly smile
back up on you at your trial
Chill and numbs from head to toe
icy sun with frosty glow
Why'd you go reaching your sorrow?
why'd you go read no tomorrow
Feel your spirit rise with the priest
feel your body falling to its knees
Take your walk of remorse
take your body to a corpse
take your body to a corpse
take your body to a corpse
if you want all remorse
take your body to a corpse
Now from darkness, there springs light
Wall of Sleep is cold and bright
Wall of Sleep is lying broken
Sun shines in, you are awoken"

Oh no never was the darkness so black,
No light and nowhere to go.
My spirit is crying for a love
So tired of being alone.
I remember He came here to steal,
and You are His stealer of souls.
I see a Black Moon rising,
and it's calling out my name.
Oh it's calling my name.
I've been blinded, lost and confused,
darkness will call me no more.
Heaven is no friend of mine,
no god ever knocked on my door.
I see a Black Moon rising,
and it's calling out my name.
Oh it's calling my name.
I'm standing on the dark side of time
Reaching for the power of Her hand.
She's weaving an unholy light
And calls from Lucifer's land.
I see a Black Moon rising,
and it's calling out my name.
An angel of Hell is rising,
heaven's no friend of mine.
I see a Black Moon rising,
and it's calling out my name,
I see a Black Moon rising,
and it causes so much pain.
An angel of Hell is rising,
heaven's no friend of mine.
I see a Black Moon rising,
and it's calling out my name.
It's calling my name,
this spirit's crying for love.
Heaven's no friend of mine."

Born Again	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/born_again-lyrics-104028.html	Born Again	"(The lyrics look correct, but wrong song, right group, album
wrong song.  Song title is Trashed!""
Ahhh, Ah
It really was a meeting
The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car
And I was going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stopwatch rolling
Had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I felt real good
I had the tape deck roaring
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn I went off exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just couldn't take it
I was turning, tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing. The bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye
Started pretty good and I was feeling my way
Had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Greenfly laughing like drains
Inebri-ocean
Crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch in my imagination
At the canal turn I hit an oily patch
Inebriation
Knew I wouldn't make it the car just couldn't take it
I was turning, tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing. The bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye
Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can ya hear my lies?
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eye
I was turning, tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing. The bitch was trashed
Death was in my eye
Ooh Mr. Miracle you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle I won't get trashed again
Ooh can ya hear my lies?
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eye...
Back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains
'Cos there was no tequila
As we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
(And) as we got trashed we were laughing still
Well bless my soul!
Yo ho jack off"

But if you lose you're gonna have to pay the price

The fear inside just up and died
Time will tell if i am wrong

Well I'm not born to lose
I'm not born to lose
You curse my name, as you turn and walk away, from view

You don't scare me cos you're
Hard to see and it's time

Buried Alive	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/buried_alive-lyrics-104031.html	Dehumanizer	"Once upon a nightmare
Once upon a time
You're running from temptation
You got lost
And found that you don't
Belong to anybody
You're all the same
Just another number
Cross it out
Whenever you don't behave
Someone got the doctor
He knows what to do
Throw some bones and mumble
The devil's inside of you
It might be contagious
It might change the plan
Get back in your tiny boxes
Even if you can't
We say you can

Everybody's got to get in line and
We never justify

When you thought you were free
You didn't need a reason
No reason to survive

As the big door closes
And you waiting for the nail
Somebody tell the world
You're buried alive
Once upon a nightmare
Once upon a time
You're running from tomorrow
You got lost
And found that another
Day has turned to ashes
Taken by the wind
Frozen seeds of sorrow
Never to begin
Join the celebration
And everybody's got to get in line and
We never justify
The choir sings a never-ending lie
Pre-chorus:
When you thought you were free
You did not need a reason
No reason to survive

The hammer falls
And no one hears you cry

There's nowhere now that you can run
All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light
Princes and Kings, Demons with wings
Summon your fears from hell
It's the call of the wild  Calling you
In this last macabre hour, witches cry
and turn to dust before the moon
Many spirits are lost forever, but one survives
To call the tune of lucifer
It's the call of the wild  Calling you
Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't beleive in fate, it ain't what it seems
All you gotta do now is stay free
You're the one they turn to when hell screams
Fear of the devil has no place among the brave
Faced with pain, there's a battle to be won
All eyes are on you, like a lost Eternal Light
Princes and Kings, Demons with wings
Summon your fears from hell
It's the call of the wild  Calling you
Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't beleive in fate, it ain't what it seems
Hero, only in the grave are there no dreams
Hero, don't beleive in fate, it ain't what it seems
Hero, you got the fear of the devil burning your soul
Hero, It's the call of the wild
Hero, Tearing your soul"

Things that we have they're for real and we're losing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Why do you believe that we've got something coming,
You took it all, left me standing here with nothing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away,
Too far away.
In your world you must be dreaming, if you think you can survive,
Taking all and giving nothing that's a crime.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
All I need is understanding and the right to survive,
Only you could see the warnings, and pass them by.
What makes you something special, what about me, I'm here too,
You don't care what I'm feeling and that's the truth.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Too far away.
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
How many tears must we cry before learning,
Things that we had they're for real and we're losing,
Can't get close enough to you, 'cause you're just too far away.
Too far away, too far away, too far away."

Just A Secret To Take When You Die.
All The World Is Watching You, Every Tongue Is Screaming Fool.
How Are Your Dreams, Do They Claw At Your Sleep
Making Darkness A Place You Despise,
Where Is The God, That Once Was Your Strength
Are You Sure He Was There From The Start.
All The World Is Watching You, Nowhere You Can Hide,
Every Tongue Is Screaming Fool, Only Satan Hears Your Cries.
When You Sin Cardinal Sin, You Make Your Bed And On It You Must Lie,
And Your Futures Looking Grim, But Did You Ever Give A Damn
About The Child, He's Running Wild.
When You Sin Cardinal Sin, Don't Expect The World Will Treat You Well,
We Say Oh, Go To Hell.
We Point The Finger, Sin Cardinal Sin, Laugh In Your Face, Sin Cardinal Sin,
We Point The Finger, Laugh In Your Face,
Cos You're No Better Than The Rest Of The Human Race.
Oh Sin Cardinal Sin, Oh Sin Cardinal Sin."
Changes	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/changes-lyrics-7145.html	Vol 4	"I feel unhappy, I feel so sad
I've lost the best friend, that I ever had.
She was my woman, I love her so.
But it's too late now, I've let her go.
I'm going through changes.
I'm going through changes.
We shared the years, we shared each day.
In love together, we found a way.
But soon the world, had it's evil way.
My heart was blinded, love went astray.
I'm going through changes.
I'm going through changes.
It took so long, to realize.
And I can still hear her last goodbyes.
Now all my days, are filled with tears.
Wish I could go back, and change these years.
I'm going through changes.
I'm going through changes."
Children Of The Grave	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/children_of_the_grave-lyrics-32392.html	Master Of Reality	"In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky
We sailed across the air before we learned to fly
We thought that it could never end
We'd glide above the ground before we learned to run, run
Now it seems our world has come undone
Oh they say that it's over
And it just had to be
Ooh they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea, oh
We made the mountains shake with laughter as we played
Hiding in our corner of the world
Then we did the demon dance and rushed to nevermore
Threw away the key and locked the door
Oh they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Yes they say that it's over
We're lost children of the sea
In the misty morning, on the edge of time
We've lost the rising sun, a final sign
As the misty morning rolls away to die
Reaching for the stars, we blind the sky
Oh they say that it's over, yeah
And it just had to be
Oh they say that it's over
Poor lost children of the sea, yeah
LOOK OUT! The sky is falling down!
LOOK OUT! The world is spinning round and round and round!
LOOK OUT! The sun is going black, black
LOOK OUT! It's never never never coming back, LOOK OUT!"
Computer God	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/computer_god-lyrics-104039.html	Dehumanizer	"Waiting for the revolution
New clear vision - genocide
Computerize god - it's the new religion
Program the brain - not the heartbeat
Onward all you crystal soldiers
Touch tomorrow - energize
Digital dreams
And you're the next correction
Man's a mistake so we'll fix it, yeah
Take a look at your own reflection
Right before your eyes
It turns to steel
There's another side of heaven
This way - to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall down
Love is automatic pleasure
Virtual reality
Terminal hate - it's a calculation
Send in the child for connection
Take a look at the toys around you
Right before your eyes
The toys are real
There's another side of heaven
This way - to technical paradise
Find it on the other side
When the walls fall down
Midnight confessions
Never heal the soul
What you believe is fantasy
Your past is your future
Left behind
Lost in time
Will you surrender
Waiting for the revolution
Program the brain
Not the heartbeat
Deliver us to evil
Deny us of our faith
Robotic hearts bleed poison
On the world we populate
Virtual existence
With a superhuman mind
The ultimate creation
Destroyer of mankind
Termination of our youth
For we do not compute
No !"
Cornucopia	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/cornucopia-lyrics-7148.html	Vol 4	"Too much in the truth they say
Keep it 'till another day
Let them have their little game
Illusion helps to keep them sane
Let them have their little toys
Fast sports cars and motor noise
Exciting in their plastic place
Frozen food in a concrete maze
You're gonna go insane
I'm trying to save your brain
I don't know what's happening
My head's all torn inside
People say I'm heavy
They don't know what I hide
Take a life, it's going cheap
Kill someone, no one will weep
Freedom's yours, just pay your dues
We just want your soul to use
You're gonna go insane
I'm trying to save your brain"
Country Girl	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/country_girl-lyrics-104041.html	Mob Rules	"Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, holy lightning
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, yeah
We sailed away on a crimson tide, gone forever
Left my heart on the other side, all to break it into bits
Her smile was a winter song, a Sabbath ending
Don't sleep or you'll find me gone, just an image in the air
In dreams I think of you
I don't know what to do with myself
Time has let me down
She brings broken dreams, fallen stars,
the endless search for where you are
(sail on, sail on)
Fell in love with a country girl, morning sunshine
She was up from a nether world, just to bust another soul
Her eyes were an endless flame, unholy lady
Desire with a special name, made to snatch your soul away, oh!
Don't sail away on a crimson tide!
Don't leave your heart on the other side!
Her eyes are an endless flame
Desire with a special name
Don't ever fall in love!
Don't give your heart away!
No never, never fall in love with a country girl!"

I I I I I
Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people, living as foes
Maybe, it's not to late
To learn how to love, and forget how to hate
Mental wounds not healing, life's a bitter shame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools
I've watched all the drop outs, who make their own rules
One person conditioned, to rule and controll
The media sells it, and you live the role
Mental wounds still screaming, driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words, Yeah yeah!
Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
Inheiriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something, that just isn't fair
Mental wounds not healing, who and what's to blame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train"

Just Turn Around Now And Walk Away.
I've Gotta Tell You, There Are No Rules Here,
Sometimes I Wonder, What Goes On There,
Behind Those-eyes.

Young Ones Crying With Their Heads In Their Hands,
When You Talk About Saving, The Souls Of The Faithful,
You Can't Help Thinking, You've Got Blood On Your Hands.
From A Cross Of Thorns.
Tongues Of Fire Always Talking, Wasted Words That Ring In My Ears.
We're Still Waiting, Losing Patience, Will All The lies of, 400 years.
I've Got To Tell You, There Are No Rules Here,
Sometimes I Wonder, What Goes On There, Behind Those-eyes.
We Gave You Yesterday, And Now You Want To-day,
Oh, From The Hands Of Death We Take Our Daily Bread,
Now All We Do Is Choke, And The Words That You Once Spoke, Fade Away.
Look At What You've Done, Oh, It's A Cross Of Thorns.
Take Away, This Cross Of Thorns, Look At What You've Done.
It's A Cross Of Thorns, Cross Of Thorns.

It's been too much, too far away from home
Hard life, living the hard life
I can't resist, I'm falling
To the danger zone
All day long I'm pushed and shoved
I just can't get enough
In the danger zone
Red light, don't stop for no red light
You know I'm always trouble on my own
Lonely, ever so lonely
I've got too much time
I'm heading for the danger zone
All day long I'm pushed and shoved
I just can't get enough
In the danger zone
I'm eager, eager to please
I can't stand no more
It's got me on my knees
Ain't gonna feel no hurt
Ain't gonna feel no pain
I got nothin' left to lose
I ain't got no shame
Don't try to stop me
Just leave me on my own
I'm gonna live or die
In the danger zone
I'm living in the danger zone
In the danger zone
Hard life, I'm living the hard life
I'm gonna take a chance
In the danger zone
Lonely, ever so lonely
I'm gonna live or die

Midnight, can't wait until midnight
Help me I'm falling to the danger zone"
Devil And Daughter	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/devil_and_daughter-lyrics-104046.html	Headless Cross	"Silence is mocking the dawn of a new day
Devil and Daughter are both on their way
The evil of her nature collects in her eyes
With him there's no fear of the dawn bringing light
Baptised with fire, too wild to be tamed
She's hot, evil and ready to take any man
Let no one put assunder the power of the pain
He is the master of hell riding again
Devil and Daughter - pleasure and pain
Devil and Daughter - is this the end
A thousand times over, you'll hear on the wind
in the name of hell, these sinners never sinned
But Satan never listens to the words that they send
Drenching the soul with blood, when will it end
Devil and Daughter
he's got the power, she's got the pain
Devil and Daughter
She'll break any woman and take any man
Devil and Daughter
Hand in hand with the reaper"

your back's to the wall
Then chase the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run,
you run, you run!
[Chorus]
So live for today
Tomorrow never comes
Die Young
Behind the smile, there's danger and a promise to be told:
you never knew.
Life's fantasy - to be locked away and still to think you're free
you're free, we're free!
[Chorus]
So live for today
Tomorrow never comes
Die Young
Die young, die young
can't you see the writing on the wall?
Die young, gonna die young
someone stopped the pain
Goto the wind, though the wind won't help you fly at all
your back's to the wall
Then chase the sun, and it tears away and it breaks you as you run,
you run, you run!
So live for today
Tomorrow never comes
Die young, young!
Die young, die young!
Die young, die young, young!
Die young, die young, die young, die young, die young!!"
Digital Bitch	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/digital_bitch-lyrics-104048.html	Born Again	"She wears her leather just to satisfy
She really throws it around
There ain't one thing she can't afford to buy
She's the richest bitch in town
Her big fat daddy was a money machine
He made a fortune from computers
She's got more money than I've ever seen
But she's a greedy emotional looter
Keep away from the digital bitch
Keep away from the digital bitch
Keep away from the digital bitch
She's so rich, the digital bitch
She's got five rollers and a fine estate
A big house up on the hill
She throws parties just to celebrate
Her life is just one enormous thrill
She buys poor people just to have around
She has a trophy for each lover
The bitch is rich but baby pound for pound
She's got a lot more to discover
Maybe she could please me if I saw beneath her veil
But she's just an imitation woman up for sale
She got so famous that she's on TV
She's got a professional smile
But I switch over 'cos she ain't for me
She disturbs me all the while
She looks so happy but she's got it wrong
She's always going faster
She sings her life to such a different song
She needs a loving and dominant master"
Dirty Women	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/dirty_women-lyrics-7172.html	Technical Ecstasy	"The neon lights are shining on me again
I walk the lonely streets in search of a friend
I need a lady to help me to get through the night, through the night
If I could find one then everything would be alright
The sleepy city is dreaming the night time away
Out on the street I watch tomorrow becoming today
I see a man, he's got take away women for sale, yes for sale
Guess that's the answer, 'cause take away women don't fail
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
You've got me coming, You've got me going around
Oh dirty women, they don't mess around
Walking the streets I wonder will it ever happen
Gotta be good 'cause then everything will be OK
If I could score tonight then I will end up happy
A woman for sale is gonna help me save my day..."
Disturbing The Priest	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/disturbing_the_priest-lyrics-104051.html	Born Again	"Let's try getting to the sky, hang on or you're going to die
Sour life can turn sweet, it's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries, keep looking at the eyes
Good life is contradiction because of the crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need, I will take your soul and plant my seed
You just gotta listen to the night at the ending of the day
You just gotta listen to the night as safety slips away
Moving out of sight are the things you need to see to feel
And as they slip away becoming so unreal unreal
You just gotta listen to the night as you're going up the stairs
You just gotta listen to the night and don't forget to say your prayers
And as you lose control to the eyes in dark disguise
And icy fingers send electric lies
We're disturbing the priest, won't you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest, not at all, not at all, not in the least
Ahhhh, Do we mind disturbing the priest
Aahhhh, not at all, not at all, not in the least
The force of the devil is the darkness the priest has to face
The force of the night will destroy him but will not disgrace
To get into his mind and to his soul you gotta set alight
The flames of doubt so deep inside inside
The devil and the priest can't exist if one goes away
It's just like the battle of the sun and the moon and night and day
The force of the devil, that's we're all told to fear
Watch out for religion when he gets too near too near
We're disturbing the priest, won't you please come to our feast
Do we mind disturbing the priest, not at all, not at all, not in the least
Good life is contradiction because of the crucifixion
If you're ready and have the need, I will take your soul and plant my seed
Aahhhh, ahhhh, ah ha ha ha haaa!
Let's try getting to the sky, hang on or you're going to die
Sour life can turn sweet, it's laying at your feet
Sweet child with an innocent smile watches closely all the while
Don't be fooled when he cries, keep looking at the eyes
Oh, disturbing the priest!"

Electric Funeral	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/electric_funeral-lyrics-7134.html	Paranoid	"Reflex in the sky warn you you're gonna die
Storm coming, you'd better hide from the atomic tide
Flashes in the sky turns houses into sties
Turns people into clay, radiation minds decay
Robot minds of robot slaves lead them to atomic rage
plastic flowers, melting sun, fading moon falls upon
dying world of radiation, victims of mad frustration
Burning globe of oxy'n fire, like electric funeral pyre
Buildings crashing down to a cracking ground
Rivers turn to wood, ice melting to flood
Earth lies in death bed, clouds cry water dead
Tearing life away, here's the burning pay
Electric Funeral

And so in the sky shines the electric eye
supernatural king takes earth under his wing
Heaven's golden chorus sings, Hell's angels flap their wings
Evil souls fall to Hell, ever trapped in burning cells!

I believe no god may save us now
Can't you see what I see
Sinners say your prayers tonite
Your judgement day is here
Child tomorrow will die, not even
Born jesus our questions
He never seems to hear
Dying for the answers may be
The price we pay, to find the
Key to our lives
Is there a heaven is there a hell
Who's this god, tell me there's
No god above, why
We chose what lord, deep
Within our souls
He's not one thing
We are his spirit
We could save this world
From destruction day
Can't you see what I see
You and I victims of their word
As the masters of power
Try to poison our world
Greed money taken over
Their souls, you're
Just mechanical brains
Politicians don't know
Just don't know

Live in, don't let it die"

No black magician telling me to get my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door and my mind has been released
Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life with no people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true
Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruin me
And I can't seem to eliminate them
People riding their real pace
Keep on running their rat race
The ante is risen once a week
In their world of make-believe
So believe what I tell you, it's the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind"

Got Hell Looking Up, Heaven Looking Down,

Never, this is the end

Help me, tell me I'm sane
I feel a change in the earth, in the wind and the rain
Save me, take me away
You know I've seen some creatures from hell and I've heard what they say!
I've got to be strong
Oh, I'm falling off the edge of the world
Think you're safe, but you're wrong!
We are falling off the edge of the world!
Look out! there's danger! no where to run!
It seems like desperate measures but sometimes it has to be done

Kiss Of Death
This is no ordinary soul, that you're destroying,
Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time.
We tried to show you on your way, but still, you cannot see, you're hurting me
You told too many lies and so it ends, yeah
You tried to touch me, but then I knew your plan,
You tried to take my world away, oh no,
Now I see it, it's as clear as day,
No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance.
You tried to lead me, to the land where you keep your lies,
But I've seen this read before, oh yeah,
There is no reason why I should listen now,
No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance.
So many people tried before, but still I came through stronger than before,
Someone like you will never get through my door no more,
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible.
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible. Yeah.
Every lie that you tell you get closer,
Closer to the edge of the Cauldron and in to the fire, yeah.
Every life you destroy will return, it will come back and haunt you,
For ever and ever.
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible.
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible. Yeah.
This is no ordinary soul that you're destroying,
Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time."

Well that ain't nice. Gotta get a grip, gotta get a hold on life,
Gotta get a grip cause you're gonna slip, yeah.
Somebody tell me, where did we lose?
Where's the point that we lost the control to live with each other?

What's the truth? will the youth find the proof for a revolution?

In the sights of the enemy's gun
Those who have taken their oaths tonight
Are well prepared they know they'll
Do or die even if it's suicide

As the skies will Burn tonite
Wasted lives and spirits run free
On the wings of no return
Dressed to kill where eagles dare
The fate of a nation's at hand
Is this the answer to the prayers
Come the dawn, thru the blood
Red skies return with tears
In their eyes, and they
Recall thou shalt not kill
And in the morning
They'll take a hero's bow
And make the ever lasting flight
Hear them calling up above all
Across the skies
Hear them calling up above from
The other side
Here them call!
Let's take a chance

On the wings of no return

I'd wanna know if I was fuckin dead,

When you've been there before
She was a gypsy woman
She was as cold as the day, yeah
She said I'd got it coming
And then she took me away, yeah
She took me through the shadows of her sunken dream
I thought it's over me, she wasn't all she seemed
She took my hand and then she started to speak
She told me she'd had the call
With eyes of fire that were burning my soul
She looked into her crystal ball
She read my fortune then she read my mind
She didn't like my thoughts at all
She showed me shadows, a spectre of life
My soul just wanted to scream
She stared so deeply into my eyes
That's when I fell into a dream
When I awoke in bed she lay beside me
And she read me with her eyes, she said
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now
So you wanna be a gypsy, come on now, now, now
Gypsy woman you're the devil in drag
You are the queen of all hell
You took my body,now you're wasting my soul
You've got me under your spell
And as the sun shines on another day
You're gonna take my mind as well,it's over

Don't bottle it in

Push the needle in, face death's sickly grin
Holes are in your skin, caused by deadly pin

When you're out of control
A slip of the tongue when
It's done, is often hard to
See it thru
So never let your words be lies
Or they'll come looking for you
It's a hard life to love
For the price of glory you left
And threw your fortunes away
Never really cared too much for
The job or the pay
You're standing in the rain with
No cover but you never complain
You're an angry young man face to
Face but your mirrors insane
It's a hard life to love
I'm simply refusing a part in your world
And I see how it burns
See how it burns
And you're simply denying the fact
That you're blind and I see no more
I see red - I only see red
Think of all the times I was
Hurting but you felt no pain
Think of all the lies you told me
Again and again
And still you see the truth
From those who continue to lie
And now you're seeking life
From those who are living to die
It's a hard life to love
I'm simply refusing a part in your world
And I see how it burns
See how it burns
And you're simply denying the fact
That you're blind and I see no more

Livin' in the fast lane ain't easy
When you run out of road
Friends will turn to strangers
When you've nowhere to go

Laughter turns to tear as love has gone
Has it gone?
Oh, it's a hard road
Oh, it's a hard road
Whirlwind churning, lovers learning
On this path of life we can't back down
Is it wrong?
Widows weeping, babies sleeping
Life becomes the singer and the song
Sing along
Oh, it's a hard road
Carry your own load
Why make the hard road?
Why can't we be friends?
No need to hurry
We'll meet in the end
Why make the hard road?
Why can't we be friends?
No need to worry
Let's sing it again
Brother's sharing, mother's caring
Nightime falling victim to the dawn
Shadows small
Days are crawling, time is calling
To the Earth that not that life has gone
Love line drawn
Oh, it's a hard road
Carry your own load
Oh, it's a hard road
Oh, it's a hard road...
We're living in sorrow, we're living the best
And look to the future, `cause life goes together now

To the hill of the headless cross,
Where all witches meet, on a night such as this
And the power of darkness is host
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul,
With an angel that fell from the sky.
Borne on the air, lot of screams and the wails
Of the masses appointed to die.
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross.
From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground.
There's been no escape from the power of Satan.
On a nation so brave and so proud
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross.
Ahahahohohoh Ahahahohohoh
Ahahahohohoh Ahahahohohoh
Ahhhhhhh...
How do ya feel when the locks refuse the key.
And the master is calling your name?
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm?
Does the tallisman protect you from pain?
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
At the headless cross, at the headless cross.
From the first evil night. when a black flash of light
Cut the crucifix half to the ground.
There's no escaping from the power of Satan.
For a people so brave and so proud
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture,
oh no oh
oh!

Ooh where will you run to?
At the Headless Cross.

There's no fire in your soul
Say you don't love me
Say you don't care
But don't leave me standing here
Your heart's like a wheel
Just waiting to roll
It's longing for freedom
To get out on the road
You're hungry for something
That you may never find
So many reasons
Your love has made you blind
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
So don't leave me standing here
Don't leave me standing here
You say you don't love me
You say you don't care
Don't leave me
Don't leave me standing here

Full of passion and pain
Told me no reason
Why I was to blame

Do me a wrong, you're a bringer of evil
The Devil is never a maker
The less that you give, you're a taker
So it's on and on and on, it's Heaven and Hell, oh well
The lover of life's not a sinner
The ending is just a beginner
The closer you get to the meaning
The sooner you'll know that you're dreaming
So it's on and on and on, oh it's on and on and on
It goes on and on and on, Heaven and Hell
I can tell, fool, fool!
Well if it seems to be real, it's illusion
For every moment of truth, there's confusion in life
Love can be seen as the answer, but nobody bleeds for the dancer
And it's on and on, on and on and on....
They say that life's a carousel
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well
The world is full of Kings and Queens
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams
It's Heaven and Hell, oh well
And they'll tell you black is really white
The moon is just the sun at night
And when you walk in golden halls
You get to keep the gold that falls
It's Heaven and Hell, oh no!Fool, fool!
You've got to bleed for the dancer!
Fool, fool!Look for the answer!
Fool, fool, fool!"

Called from afar to the court of the Czar
Could it be something is wrong?
You stand face to face and your heart gathers pace
for the answer to a question a prize
If only you had known to be honest was wrong
For the work that you've done you will pay with your eyes
Into the black where the night
never ends and the light
leaves a scar on your soul
where your heart used to hold
your love here!
Heaven in Black
Inside there's a voice saying was there a choice
you'd still be entombed in the night
Lucifer's to blame, the reason for the flame
They've taken your sight but they'll not take your God

never ends and the light

I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine
I'm living in a room without any view
I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonyms of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
Window in time, through it I fly
I've seen the stars disappear in the sun
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars
I don't believe there's any future in cause
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
Window in time, through it I fly
Yeah

I've seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
But now I'm living on the profits of pride"

Back on earth the flame of life burns low
Everywhere is misery and woe
Pollution kills the air, the land and sea
Man prepares to meet his destiny
Rocket engines burning fuel so fast
Up into the night sky so vast
Burning metal through the atmosphere
Earth remains in worry, hate and fear
With the hateful battles raging on
rockets flying to the glowing sun
Through the empires of eternal void
Freedom from the final suicide
Freedom fighters sent out to the sun
escape from brainwashed minds and pollution.
Leave the earth to all its sin and hate
find another world where freedom waits.
Past the stars in fields of ancient void
Through the shields of darkness where they find
Love upon a land a world unknown
where the sons of freedom make their home
Leave the earth to Satan and his slaves
leave them to their future in the grave
Make a home where love is there to stay"

They were always seeking but they'll never find it
It's alright, yes it's alright
Where to go and where to see
It's always been this way and it can never be
It's alright, yes it's alright
Give it all and ask no return
And very soon you'll see and you'll begin to learn
That's it's alright, yes it's alright
Don't you know that it's so good for you
You can be making love and see it all go through
But it's alright, yes it's alright"
Jerusalem	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/jerusalem-lyrics-104096.html	Headless Cross	"The highway's screamin', callin' out your name
Cause every road that you travel on
there's a price to pay
A thousand eyes are starin'
but the blind still lead the blind
Where will you turn if it all goes wrong
and you're on the run Jerusalem?
You say you walked through the valley
you say you've seen the signs
Echoes call you from a distant age
Or is it in your mind?
Then a thousand souls rise from the sea
holding up the sun
And an angel cries 'beware your lies'
It could be the end of it all
Where will you turn if it all goes wrong
and you're on the run Jerusalem?
Everybody knows your name, every road leads to anger
Will it always be the same, is there reason to return?
Where will you turn if it all goes wrong
and you're on the run Jerusalem?
When an angel cries - Jerusalem
Better watch your lies - Jerusalem
When an angel cries - Jerusalem"
Johnny Blade	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/johnny_blade-lyrics-7174.html	Never Say Die	"Tortured and twisted, he walks the streets alone
People avoid him, they know the street's his own
Cold blade of silver, his eyes they burn so wild
Mean as a tiger, society's own child
Go the tiger, burn in hate
You know you have to, Johnny Blade
He's the meanest guy around his town
One look and he will cut you down
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade
Life has no meaning, and Death's his only friend
Will fate surprise him, where will he meet his end?
He feels so bitter, yes he's so full of hate
To die in the gutter, I guess that's Johnny's fate
Rivals all across the land
He kills them with his knife in hand
He's the meanest guy around his town
One look and he will cut you down
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade
Johnny Blade, Johnny Blade
Well you know that Johnny's a spider
And his web is the city at night
He's a victim of modern frustration
That's the reason he's so ready to fight
He's the one that should be afraid
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?
Oh he knows his future's decided
And he ain't gonna change it, no way
He was born to die in the gutter
He'll keep fighting `till the end of his days
Been alone all through his life
His only friend is a switchblade knife
He's the one who should be afraid
What will happen to you, Johnny Blade?
You fool the people
Who's fooling who?
It's time to listen
Who's fool are you?"
Junior's Eyes	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/juniors_eyes-lyrics-7175.html	Never Say Die	"Junior's eyes looked up to the skies in tears
He prayed that his maker, the giver and taker, would `pear
Junior sighed, as his hands reached out to the sky
Junior cried, the day that his best friend died
Yeah!
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye
Junior's eyes, they couldn't disguise the pain
His father was leaving, and Junior's grieving again
Innocent eyes watched the man who had gave everything
Junior's sorrow, who knew what tomorrow would bring?
Yeah!
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye
Junior's eyes looked into the skies once more
Now he knew well, this life was hell for sure
He desperately tried, his fingertips stretched to the stars, yeah
Reaching for reason, along with the time and the stars
Yeah!
They're coming home again tomorrow
I'm sorry it won't be for long
With all the pain I've watched you live within
I'll try my hardest not to cry
When it is time to say goodbye"
Keep It Warm	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/keep_it_warm-lyrics-104098.html	Born Again	"Sweet woman are you feeling right
What was it that you did last night
You made me crazy you made me fly
I can't forget the hungry look in your eye
Ooh what's the matter with me
I'm justa runner I was born free
But since I met you I can't leave you alone
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home
Keep it warm at the place by your side
Nobody's gonna take away our magical ride
Keep it warm for me when we talk on the phone
Don't forget will you pretty one that your man is coming homne
D'you hear the rumor that is going around
Say I'm ruined 'cos I'm settled down
It's not true well maybe half and half
you know I love you but I still like a laugh
Ooh I'm feeling fine I got it right for the first time
Sweet woman I can't stay for long, but every one will be proved wrong
I'm like a gypsy, I need to roam, but don't worry I'll be coming home
I need the danger I need the thrill
I need to know what is over each hill
Ooh I'm a different man I'm still running but you understand
since I met you I can't leave you alone
I'm leaving now but I'll be coming home"
Kill In The Spirit World	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/kill_in_the_spirit_world-lyrics-104099.html	Headless Cross	"There's something wrong there's a chill in the air
and the blood in my vein's running colder
The eastern sky is beginning to silver
and the words that you speak start to falter
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
In the house of the dead there's a taker
Some say that this is the ultimate sin
When the spirit world turns to the alter
There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
Behold the dead clutching at fading hands, out of reach forever
""In glory die"" calls the voice of the void
Your assassin has cursed every spectre
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
and the house of the dead seeks a master
Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end
and a kiss on the wind whispers murder, Murder
There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
When heaven is closer, it's pleasure and pain
Kill in the spirit world
Did you see another in black
is the blood in your veins running colder
If you did then there's no turning back
As the spirit world turns to the alter
The seal is broken, the oath has been crossed
and the house of the dead seeks the master
Stretching every muscle, I wait for the end
and a kiss on the wind whispers murder, Murder
There's been a kill in the spirit world
There's been a kill in the spirit world
Oh here it comes, oh no
The seal is broken, The eastern sky is beginning to silver
There's something wrong, there's a chill in the air
I feel the evil, I feel the evil
Somebody whispers murder
A kiss on the wind whispers murder"

Well I don't think that I even care
You work your life away and what do they give?
You're only killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live

Just take a look around you what do you see
Pain, suffering, and misery
It's not the way that the world was meant
It's a pity you don't understand
Killing yourself to live
Killing yourself to live
I'm telling you
Believe in me
Nobody else will tell you
Open your eyes
And see the lies, oh yeah
You think I'm crazy and baby
I know that it's true
Before that you know it I think
That you'll go crazy too
I don't know if I'm up or down
Whether black is white or blue is brown
The colors of my life are all different somehow
Little boy blue's a big girl now
So you think it's me who's strange
But you've never had to make the change
Never give your trust away
You'll end up paying till your dying day"
Kiss Of Death	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/kiss_of_death-lyrics-358301.html	The Sabbath Stones	"This is no ordinary soul, that you're destroying,
Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time.
We tried to show you on your way, but still, you cannot see,
you're hurting me You told too many lies and so it ends, yeah
You tried to touch me, but then I knew your plan,
You tried to take my world away, oh no,
Now I see it, it's as clear as day,
No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance.
You tried to lead me, to the land where you keep your lies,
But I've seen this read before, oh yeah,
There is no reason why I should listen now,
No you'll never stand a chance, oh no you'll never stand a chance.
So many people tried before, but still I came through stronger than before,
Someone like you will never get through my door no more,
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible.
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible. Yeah.
Every lie that you tell you get closer,
Closer to the edge of the Cauldron and in to the fire, yeah.
Every life you destroy will return, it will come back and haunt you,
For ever and ever.
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible.
Nothing you can do will hurt me, I am indestructible. Yeah.
This is no ordinary soul that you're destroying,
Not just another life that drifts along with the sands of time."
Lady Evil	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/lady_evil-lyrics-104101.html	Heaven Hell	"There's a place just south of Witches' Valley
where they say the wind won't blow
and they only speak in whispers of a name
There's a lady they say who feeds the darkness
it eats right from her hand
With a crying shout she'll search you out
and freeze you where you stand
Lady Evil, evil
she's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil in my mind
She's queen of the night
all right!
In a place just south of Witches' Valley
where they say the rain won't fall
Thunder cracks the sky, it makes you bleed
There's a lady they say who needs the darkness
she can't face the light
with an awful shout, she'll find you out
and have you before the night
Lady Evil, evil
she's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil on my mind
She's queen of the night
So if you ever get to Witches' Valley
Don't dream or close your eyes
and never trust your shadow in the dark
'Cause there's a lady I know who takes your vision
and turns it all around
the things you see are what you'll be, lost and never found
Lady Evil, evil
she's a magical, mystical woman
Lady Evil, evil on my mind
She's queen of the night
Gonna do you right!
She's the queen of sin
Look out, she'll pull you in!

He'll show you no mercy
Your image in his hands, it's useless to try
Escaping his curses
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls
Tourted and flaming, you'll give birth to hell
Living a nightmare
It is a pity, you'll pray for your death
But he's in no hurry
The pins and needles prick the skin of little dolls
(CHORUS)
Nowhere to run
Your fate is in his hands
Your time has come
You'll live to his command
I'm warning you
The worst is yet to come
The killer who
Remains a mystery
I that believe in the stories of old
Would never fight it
Demons and curses that play on your soul
Like something ignited
You never imagined such a fate could follow you
(You never thought it was true)
And when it's your time I wonder how
(And what you'll do)
Your kinds of troubles running deeper than the sea
(So what you gonna do about it)
You broke(the rule)
You've been(a fool)
The little doll is you, YEAH!

Writhing and screaming, the pain just won't go
He'll show you no mercy
Your image in his hands, it's useless to try
Escaping his curses

Looking For Today	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/looking_for_today-lyrics-7163.html	Sabbath Bloody Sabbath	"It's complete but obsolete
All tomorrow's become yesterday
In demand but second hand
It's been heard before you even play
Up to date but came too late
Better get yourself another name
You're so right but overnight
You're the one who has to take the blame
Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried
Don't delay you're in today
But tomorrow is another dream
Sunday's star is Monday's scar
Out of date before you're even seen
At the top so quick to flop
You're so new but rotting in decay
Like butterfly so quick to die
But you're only looking for today
Everyone just gets on top of you
The pain begins to eat your pride
You can't believe in anything you knew
When was the last time that you cried
Looking for today
Glamour trip so soon to slip
Easy come but oh how quick it goes
Ten foot tall but what to fall
Hard to open yet so easy to close
Front page news but so abused
You just want to hide yourself away
Over-paid, but soon you fade
Because you're only looking for today
Looking for today"

you think you know but you are never quite sure
your soul is ill but you will not find a cure.
Your world was made for you by someone above
but you chose evil ways instead of love.
You made me master of the world where you exist
the soul I took from you was not even missed.

You say you're not to blame
In your head voices mocking every prayer
Remember the face you saw
That once was you
Spirit high there's no way that
You could lose
Give him rope they said
As you look the hangman in the eye
Now around your neck you feel
The noose
In your head voices mocking every prayer
Now you're lost forever
I'm burning with fire it's time to
Leave or get out
I'm burning in fire I can't take
No more so get out
I'm burning with fire the wheels of
Steel will grind you
Burning in fire this time

I'm seeing nowhere through the eyes of a lie
I'm getting closer to the end of the line
I'm living easy where the sun doesn't shine
I'm living in a room without any view
I'm living free because the rent's never due
The synonyms of all the things that I've said
Are just the riddles that are built in my head
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
Window in time, through it I fly
I've seen the stars disappear in the sun
The shooting's easy if you've got the right gun
And even though I'm sitting waiting for Mars
I don't believe there's any future in cause
Hole in the sky, take me to heaven
Window in time, through it I fly
Yeah
I've watched the dogs of war enjoying their feast
I've seen the western world go down in the east
The food of love became the greed of our time
But now I'm living on the profits of pride"

It's like a trip inside a separate mind
The ghost of tomorrow from my favorite dream
Is telling me to leave it all behind
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Got to get to happiness, want no more of sorrow
How I lied, went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right if I fight?
That I might just get away from you now
Sting me!
Well I feel something's giving me the chance to return
It's giving me the chance of saving my soul
Beating the demigod, I'm fading away
I'm going backwards but I'm in control
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Getting back to sanity, providence of sorrow
Was it wise to disguise
How I tried to get away from you now
Is there a way that I could pay
Or is it true I have to stay with you now?
How I lied, went to hide
How I tried to get away from you now
Am I right if I fight?
That I might just get away from you now
Suck me!
I'm really digging schizophrenia the best of the earth
I've seized my soul in the fires of hell
Peace of mind eluded me, but now it's all mine
I simply try, but he wants me to fail
Feel it slipping away, slipping in tomorrow
Now I've found my happiness, providence of sorrow
No more lies, I got wise
I despise the way I worshipped you yeah
Now I'm free, can't you see
And now instead I won't be led by you now

Follow me now and you will not regret

Never Say Die	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/never_say_die-lyrics-7173.html	Never Say Die	"People going nowhere, taken for a ride
Looking for the answers that they know inside
Searching for a reason, looking for a rhyme
Snow White's mirror said ""partners in crime!""
Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
Sunday's satisfaction, Monday's home and dry
Truth is on the doorstep, welcome in the lie
All dressed up in sorrow, got no place to go
Hold back, `till it's ready, taking it slow
Don't they ever have to worry?
Don't you ever wonder why?
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again
Don't you ever say die
Don't you ever say die
Never say die
Panic, silver lining, writing's on the wall
Children get together, you can save us all
Future's on the corner, throwing us a die
Slow down, turn around, everything's fine
There's no need to have a reason
There's no need to wonder why
It's a part of me that tells you
Oh, don't you ever, don't ever say die
Never, never, never say die again"
Nightmare	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/nightmare-lyrics-104120.html	Eternal Idol	"Close my eyes starting dreaming
See a vision filled with wings
Head my way
Feel the presence of unknown power
Telling me to come
This is the only way
It's dream within dream
Lost and lonely
Don't get pulled by the devil's hand
Silent screamer filled with fear
As the night time shapes a face
Then disappears
Scared forever into believing
That your mind has met the
Prince of whom you see
It's dream within dream
Lost and lonely
Don't get fooled by the
Devil's hand
It's dream within dream
Fool forever, don't get fooled
Forever
Don't get fooled, be the devil
In your eyes
The evil spirit rises
Blinded by the dark
You fall into shame
As the reaper takes you
Down the spiral stairway
You share the evil pit
With satan's name
Nightmare it's got me runnin'
Nightmare it's calling you
Nightmare it's got me runnin'
Nightmare it's calling you
It's dream within a dream
Lost and lonely
Don't get fooled, be the devil
It's dream within a dream
Lost forever
Don't get fooled
It's got me running
It's just a nightmare
It's got me running
It's got me running"
Nightwing	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/nightwing-lyrics-104121.html	Headless Cross	"Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight
The silence is over, he's shattered the night
No other hunter has the power or the grace
He is the master of this place
Tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
So listen my friend
Nightwing flies again
They say he comes for those whose souls are weak
and call his name upon the wind
The night is cold and thick with mystery
Oh I can feel his beating wings
Tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Nightwing flies again
Tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
Nightwing flies again
Nightwing has stirred, and taken to flight
The silence is over, he's shattered the night
Life ain't for giving and forgiving ain't free
No soul will rest while the hunted run free
So tell every creature of the night
The kill is around the bend
listen my friend
Nightwing flies again"

Lonely till dawn
Cry for the light
For the love that won't come
You said that you'd never
Leave me alone
I gave you my heart
You cried for my soul
An angel won't come
This devil won't go
Something is wrong
I just can't get away
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
But I'm a stranger in your arms
Yes, I'm a stranger in your arms
Maybe it's right
But I just can't understand
The hurt that I feel
For my love second hand
I know I should leave
But I just can't walk away
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
I'm a stranger in your arms
Living on the street, I'm no stranger to love
Why can't you see I'm no stranger to love"

The dreams you had were once of love and being proud
Misty horizons block your vision of the world
But the raven's eyes will show you all you need to know

The name of God rings out so high in your soul
This time the masters will lead us by the sword
And should we fail then all prevails in Odin's court"

Cold blooded spoof
Raised in the prison
You called the school
Taught young in legends
Told what to do
I handed my childhood
Over to you
Travelling endlessly, I'm searching for mind
I'm almost afraid of what I will find
Wandering aimlessly, oh what can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you
Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?
Watching for freedom
Fighting our wars
Feeding our children
Keeping your laws
Someday you'll suffer
And what I'll do
I'll hand all your promises
Over to you
Standing inside myself, I'm losing control
You made me believe in the stories you told
Waiting impatiently, what else can I do?
I handed my future over to you, to you
Over to you
Future looks blue
What can I do?
Tears filled of sadness
Stealing myself
Which burning secrets?
What to they tell?
Mad politicians
Can tell it true
I handed my children
Over to you
All over, over to you
All over, over to you
All over, over to you..."

All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify
Can you help me occupy my brain?
Oh yeah
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me us so unreal
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late"

And you were free to run away
And get out
Would you get out of there

The snowflakes glisten on the tree
The sun no longer sets me free
I feel there's no place freezing me
Let the winter sun shine on
Let me feel the frost of dawn
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow
Soon I'll feel the chilling glow
Don't you think I know what I'm doing
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong
You're the one who's really a loser
This is where I feel I belong
Crystal world with winter flowers
Turns my day to frozen hours
Lying snowblind in the sun
Will my ice age ever come?"
Solitude	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/solitude-lyrics-32394.html	Master Of Reality	"My name it means nothing
my fortune is less
My future is shrouded in dark wilderness
Sunshine is far away, clouds linger on
Everything I posessed - Now they are gone
Oh where can I go to and what can I do?
Nothing can please me only thoughts are of you
You just laughed when I begged you to stay
I've not stopped crying since you went away
The world is a lonely place - you're on your own
Guess I will go home - sit down and moan.
Crying and thinking is all that I do
Memories I have remind me of you"
Spiral Architect	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/spiral_architect-lyrics-7164.html	Sabbath Bloody Sabbath	"Sorcerers of madness
selling me their time
Child of God sleeping in the sun
Keeping peace of mind
Pictures of seduction
On a flat stone sky
Sadness fills the supermen
Even fathers cry
Of all the things I value most of all
I look inside myself
And see my world
And know that it is good
You know that I should
Superstitious century
Didn't time go slow
Separating sanity
Watching children grow
Synchranated underneath
The Spiral sky
Silver ships on plasmic oceans
In disguise
Of all the things I value most in life
I see my memories
And feel their warmth
And know that they are good
You know that I should
Watching eyes of celluloid
Tell you how to live
Metophoric motories
Say give, give, give
Laphitistic love is showing
How to lead the way
Spiral City architect
I feel you're pain
Of all the things I value most of all
I look upon my Earth
And feel the warmth
And know that it is good
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should
You know that I should"
St. Vitus' Dance	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/st_vitus_dance-lyrics-7149.html	Vol 4	"So you think you know
What's going on inside her head
You think she wants your money
But it's you she wants instead
When you think about the things
That she did long ago
It breaks your heart, but deep down
Boy, you don't want her to go
You really look so shattering
You feel you want to die
Just because of the one mistake
Of telling you a lie
If I were you I'd try again
And try to make amends
She only thinks of you, you know
I'm talking as a friend"
Supernaut	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/supernaut-lyrics-7146.html	Vol 4	"Look through the people, and on through the mist
to the hill of the headless cross
Where all witches meet, on a night such as this
and the power of darkness is host
They come face to face, eye to eye, soul to soul
with and Angel that fell from the sky
Borne on the air, the screams and the wails
of the masses appointed to die
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross
From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's been no escape from the power of Satan
on a nation so brave and so proud
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross
How do you feel, when the locks refuse the key
and the master is calling your name
Does the luck of the charm, really keep you from harm?
does the talisman protect you from pain?
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross
From the first evil night, when a black flash of light
cut the crucifix half to the ground
There's no escaping the power of Satan
on a nation so brave and so proud
Listen for the feet as they pound the land to a tune of thunder
Watch as the legions ride again to a fate of death or torture, oh no, oh
At the Headless Cross, at the Headless Cross
At the Headless Cross, oh, at the Headless Cross
Where will you run to?
At the Headless Cross
Look, to the Headless Cross"

Won't you listen?
When I first met you, didn't realize
I can't forget you, for your surprise
you introduced me, to my mind
And left me wanting, you and your kind
I love you, Oh you know it
My life was empty, forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear
Come on now, try it out
Straight people don't know, what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
you gave to me a new belief
and soon the world will love you sweet leaf"

And we're sad and sorry
Really sorry that it happened that way

Compare ourselves with others
And cover them in sin
Oh, God what a terrible
A terrible state we're in
There must be some way out of here
A comprimise that's right
If we cannot work it out
We're gonna have to fight

Electrifying enemy is drowning in his tears
All I have to give you is a love that never dies

Father of creation takes me from my stolen tomb
Seventh night the unicorn is waiting in the skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah
Take my hand, my child of love come step inside my tears
Swim the magic ocean I've been crying all these years
When our love will ride away into eternal skies
A symptom of the universe, a love that never dies
Yeah
Oh my child of love's creation, come and step inside my dreams
In your eyes I see no sadness, you are all that loving means
Take my hand and we'll go riding through the sunshine from above
We'll find happiness together in the summer skies of love"

Can't Rest, Can't Sleep, For Dreams That Set You Falling.
Don't Feel The Hunger, Can't Drink No Holy Water,
No Light In These Eyes, No Place For Dreams At All Tonight.
When The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, Is The Hand That Holds The Knife,
And The Knife That Cuts The Cable, Kills The Spark That Feeds The Life.
No Grave Could Be Deep Enough, Down To Hell If We Were Able,
The Veil Of Life Was Pushed Aside, By The Hand That Rocks The Cradle.
The Oath You Take Is Sacred, To Save Not Steel A Life,
Like The Passing Of The Sweetest Soul, That Looked Through Human Eyes
Young Life, Too Young, Who's Eyes Are Choking,
Can't Rest, Can't Sleep, For Dreams That Set You Falling.
Don't Feel The Hunger, Can't Drink No Holy Water,
No Light In These Eyes, No Place For Dreams At All Tonight.

The Illusion Of Power	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/the_illusion_of_power-lyrics-104160.html	Forbidden	"What is it that turns you on to the illusion of power,
This thing that grabs you by the heart and makes you want to tear things down.
There is no reason why I should need all this power, but if you cross me now,
I'm gonna tear your whole world down.
The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,
The illusion of power.
I can't get the emotional thing straight in my head,
Everything I love dies too soon, or is already dead.
Don't stand too close I spit and breathe fire,
Anything I've got now you cannot desire.
You want to be my friend, I promise you nothing.
Nothing I can give you, nothing I can do for you,
I'm being chased by the sins of my past and it's killing me now,
Killing me now.
The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,
The illusion of power.
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed,
The illusion of power.
Fool, you're caught in a complex catacomb of your own inadequcies and pitiful weaknesses,
Your soul secretes insecurity.
So you live on the reflection side of the mirror; you're terrified of true power.
You Fear
I can tell you stories of my
shaded past and I can drag you down into the depths of my soul.
The illusion of power, things I feel, seem so real,
The illusion of power.
The illusion of power, it's already set signed and sealed,
The illusion of power.
Why don't you come closer, Promise a story I will tell, yeah,
I'll save you from your dreams, yeah
I'll save you from your dreams."

close your eyes and pray it's a vision of God's command
He's evil and mysterious
People fear his name
He's not here for deliverance, no
He's the Lawmaker
He never speaks, but his task we're told
To seek out souls of the sinners, he'll trade for gold
He's evil and mysterious
People fear his name
He's not here for deliverance, no
He's the Lawmaker
Silver mountains won't save you from hell
The prince of darkness inside you will dwell
Oh your weakness your past

wings that carry hell in every vein
World possessions, endless taers
truth and knowledge stolen all their years
World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence stills the air and kills the chime
Words are poison, passion bleeds
2000 years on earth has sown the seeds
The time of dreams has turned
The night is gone and light shines on
Where darkness once would hide
With spirits high, our fears were born
Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you
Keep you from a restless heart
Deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs
within you, the reason for the restless heart
is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones
Fire and water, wind and rain
wings that carry hell in every vein
World turns slowly, sun don't shine
Silence stills the air and kills the chime
Can faith destroy desire? Each breath a prayer
each step brings fear
The eyes of they that see have evil stare
Watch over me
Receiver of light, the kingdom of God will guide you
Keep you from a restless heart
Deceiver of night, the stranger that laughs
within you, the reason for the restless heart
is the keeper of the Sabbath Stones
and He's the keeper of the Sabbath Stones
What God is this that stands to hear his people cry?
What hand would strike and watch his people die?
What life that takes, what future did we earn?
It's our mistakes, take heed the Sabbath Stones
What life that takes what future did we earn?
It's our mistakes"

Beware of the ones with invisible friends
They will steal into your mind
And all too soon the signs begin to show
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again
As the pages turn and the story's told
From the visions he's seen
The house on the hill
With the haunted eyes that call
Noone laughed as madness came out
To play it's game
If you stay too long you'll finally go insane
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Fools again
Bells will take their toll
On your way
There's no way we're born to shine
Before our time, all your life
You're on your own
Lonely road
Lost in a time
Let the light lead your way
To the golden throne
It's the only way
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up to the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Rise up to the shining
Live long live now
Rise up the shining
Don't be blind by fools again
Oh rise up, to the shining
Wise up they're gonna steal your mind
Rise up, the house is gonna haunt you
No one laughed, no one cried
You stayed too long
You're finally gonna stay"
The Straightener	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/the_straightener-lyrics-1163889.html	-	"Long ago I wandered through my mind
In the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I had no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
Was it illusion?
Soon the days went passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was born of fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
Was it illusion?
Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through furnace of tears
Eyes full of angered illusion
Hiding in every ???
So I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, just to be a loser
The world will still be turning when you're gone
Yeah when you're gone!"

Clutching violently we whisper with a liquefying cry

Won't you help me mister Jesus?
Won't you tell me if you can?
When you see this world we live in
Do you still believe in man?
If my songs become my freedom
And my freedom turns to gold
Then I'll ask the final question
If the answer could be sold
Well, that's my story and I'm sticking to it
'Cos I got no reason to lie, yeah
Forget your problems that don't even exist
And I'll show you a way to get by, oh yeah
So come along, you know you matter to me
Remember freedom is not hard to find, yeah
Time to stop all your messing around
Don't you think that I know my own mind, oh yeah
Why can't you believe, it's not here to perceive
Do you always have to be told, yeah
For you have been taught that if your mind has been bought

Without warning, the wizard walks by
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell
Funny clothes, tinkling bell
Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic
Evil power disappears
Demons worry when the wizard is near
He turns tears into joy
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by
Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic
Sun is shining, clouds have gone by
All the people give a happy sigh
He has passed by, giving his sign
Left all the people feeling so fine
Never talking
Just keeps walking
spreading his magic"

Ladies digging gold from you
Will they still dig now you're through
Yeah you're through
You bought and sold me with your lying words
The voices in the deck that you never heard came through
Yeah came through
Your folly finally got to spend with a gun
A poisoned father who has poisoned his son, that's you
Yeah that's you
I beg you please don't let it get any worse
The anger I once had has turned to a curse on you
Yeah curse you
All of the promises that never came true
You're gonna get what is coming to you, that's true
Ah, that's true
Are you Satan, are you man?
You've changed in life since it began
It began
Vultures sucking gold from you
Will they still suck now you're through

The search is on, so you just better run
And find yourself another way
Probably dead, they don't feel a thing
To keep them living for another day
(Rats, Rat)
You are nonentity, you have no destiny
You are a victim of a thing unknown
A mantle picture of a stolen soul
A fornication of your golden throne
A smiling face, it means the world to me
So tired of sadness and of misery
My life it started some time ago
Where it will end, I don't know
I thought I was so good
I thought I was fine
I feel my world is out of time
But everything is gonna work out fine
If it don't I think I'll lose my mind
I know, I know, I know, yeah yeah I know

Too many people advising me

The bottle took a beating
The ladies of the manor
Watched me climb into my car and I was
Going down the track about a hundred and five
They had the stopwatch rolling
I had the headlights blazing I was really alive
And yet my mind was blowing
I drank a bottle of tequila and I felt real good
But on the twenty-fifth lap at the canal turn
I went off exploring
I knew I wouldn't make it the car just wouldn't make it
I was turning the tires burning
The ground was in my sky
I was laughing the bitch was trashed
And death was in my eye
I had started pretty good and I was feeling my way
I had the wheels in motion
There was Peter and the Greenfly laughing like drains
Inebriation
The crowd was roaring I was at Brands Hatch
In my imagination
But at the canal turn I hit an oily patch
Inebriation
Ooh Mr. Miracle, you saved me from some pain
I thank you Mr. Miracle, I won't get trashed again
Ooh, can you hear my lies
Don't you bother with this fool just laugh into my eyes
So we went back to the bar and hit the bottle again
But there was no tequila
Then we started on the whiskey just to steady our brains
'Cause there was no tequila
And as we drank a little faster at the top of our hill
We began to roll
And as we got trashed we were laughing still
Oh bless my soul"

Under The Sun	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/under_the_sun-lyrics-104178.html	Black Box: The Complete Original Black Sabbath	"Well I don't want no jesus freak to tell me what it's all about
No black magician telling me to cut my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in your peace
I've opened the door now; my mind has been released
Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life; I don't want people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true
Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruinte
I can see through their frustration
People hiding their real face
Keep on running their rat race
The ante is risen once a week
In their world of make-believe
So believe what I tell you, it's the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind"

No black magician telling me to get my soul out
Don't believe in violence, I don't even believe in peace
I've opened the door and my mind has been released
Well I don't want no preacher telling me about the god in the sky
No I don't want no one to tell me where I'm gonna go when I die
I wanna live my life with no people telling me what to do
I just believe in myself, 'cause no one else is true
Every day just comes and goes
Life is one big overdose
People try to ruin me
And I can't seem to eliminate them
People riding their real pace
Keep on running their rat race
The ante is risen once a week
In their world of make-believe
So believe what I tell you, it's the only way to fight in the end
Just believe in yourself, you know you really shouldn't have to pretend
Don't let those empty people try and interfere with your mind
Just live your life and leave them all behind"
Valhalla	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/valhalla-lyrics-104180.html	Headless Cross	"Leading us on, to the land of eternity
Riding the cold cold winds of Valhalla
The Kingdom of Odin is the Kingdom of Gods
Where only souls of the brave may rest in peace
But someone among them had the skill of deceit
And raised the hand that would open the road to Hel
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Valhalla
The ring has been broken and a soul must be saved
Among the bravest of men, who rides to Hel
The longships are sailing and the chariots ride
And yes the anger of Thor will serve you well
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Valhalla
Raise your hands
reach and Valhalla will save your soul
Raise your eyes
and Odin will lead us on
They say that history repeats itself
upon the year of the seventh century
Well nobody knows, no you never can tell
So you'd better run now and hide away
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Be sure that the blood will start to flow
When the winds of Valhalla run cold
Valhalla"

you can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
nothin you do will be new, 'cause I'm through
Call me a liar, you knew
you were a fool, but that's cool, it's all right
Call me the Devil, it's true
some can't accept but I crept inside you
So if a stranger calls you
Don't let him whisper his name
'Cause it's Voodoo, oh!
Fade into shadow, you'll burn
your fortune is free, I can see it's no good
Never look back, never turn
It's a question of time 'till your mine and you learn
So if a stranger sees you
Don't look in his eyes
'Cause he's Voodoo!
Say you don't know me, you'll burn
you can refuse, but you'll lose, it's by me
Say you don't want me, you'll learn
nothin you do will be new, 'cause I'm through

Bring me your children, they'll burn!
Never look back, never turn!
Cry me a river, you'll learn Voodoo!!"
Walk Away	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/walk_away-lyrics-104186.html	Heaven Hell	"Lord she's handsome as she flows across the floor
Nothing I've seen in my life has ever pleased me more
She's got the look of freedom, and it makes you think she's wild
But I can see right through it all, it's the way to have a child
Oh, walk away
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Walk away, walk on
She moves in sunlight, never seen the night at all
Like a star in the midnight sky, burns before it falls
I've never been lonely, and I can't imagine why
Maybe she could be the one to tell me, I guess it's do or die
Can't see her fire
But I can feel her heat, all right!
It's rising higher
I'm walking the wire
Walk on by!
Oh! Walk away!
She's looking to love you
There's nothing to say
Just turn your head and walk away
Oh, walk on by, walk away!
Walk on!
You'll feel her fire, she'll lift you higher
But don't be fooled! just turn your head and walk away!"

Bodies burning in red ashes
On the hill the church in ruin.
Is the scene of evil doings
It's a place for all bad sinners
Watch them eating dead rats' innards.
I guess it's the same, where ever you may go
Oh lord yeah
Carry banners which denounce the lord
See me rocking in my grave
See them anoint my head with dead rat's blood
See them stick the stake through me
Oh
Don't hold me back cause I just gotta go
They've got a hold of my soul now
Lords got my brain instinct with blood obscene
Look in my eyes I'm there enough
Yeah
On the scene a priest appears
Sinners falling at his knees
Satan sends out funeral pyre
Casts the priest into the fire
It's the place for all bad sinners.
Watch them eating dead rats' innards

Oh lord yeah"

Do well best, someone else has better seen
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

Now I know just what you're looking for
You want me to claim that child you bore
Well you know that it must he not be
And you know the way it got to be
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with...
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Wickedness lies in your moisten lips
Your body moves just like the crack of a whip
Blackness sleeps on top of your stray bed
Do you whish that you could see me dead
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me
Evil woman, don't you play your games with me

Warning	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/warning-lyrics-7129.html	Black Sabbath	"Now the first day that I met ya
I was looking in the sky
When the sun turned all a blur
and the thunderclouds rolled by
The sea began to shiver
and the wind began to moan
It must've been a sign for me
to leave you well alone
I was born without you, baby
but my feelings were a little bit too strong
you never said you love me
and I don't believe you can
'cause I saw you in a dream
and you were with another man
You looked so cool and casual
and I tried to look the same
But now I've got to know ya
tell me who am I to blame?
I was born without you, baby
but my feelings were a little bit too strong
Now the whole wide world is movin'
'cause there's iron in my heart
I just can't keep from cryin'
'cause you say we've got to part
Sorrow grips my voice as I stand here all alone
And watch you slowly take away
a love I've never known
I was born without you, baby
but my feelings were a little bit too strong"

They spend and learn in Heaven, sin in Hell
What's the point of children
When evil got before them?
They learn in every tale we tell
There's no point in being kind
What's the use when love becomes an evil of the mind?
Oh Yeah!
What's the use of power
When the battle isn't equal
And we're all too Scared to use it anyway?
What's the point of reason
When no one wants to listen?
Deliverance is all too far away

in the land of fairy tales and stories
Lost in happiness I had no fears
Innocence and love was all I knew
was it illusion?
Soon the days went passing into years
Happiness just didn't come so easy
Life was born of fairy tales and daydreams
Innocence was just another word
was it illusion?
Lost in the wheels of confusion
Running through furnace of tears
Eyes full of angered illusion
Hiding in every ???
So I found that life is just a game
But you know there's never been a winner
Try your hardest, just to be a loser
The world will still be turning when you're gone
yeah when you're gone!"

His skin crept cold knowing that this was the hours of dying
Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me
Spirit of man, cannot be freed.
When Death Calls - This is the hours of dying
When Death Calls - The spirit of man cannot be freed
When Death Calls - There's no tomorrow
When Death Calls - Just an evil shadow
Tell me not fear of the flames means that heaven is closer
For I believe Satan lives, in the souls of the dying
Misguided mortals, you'll burn with me
Spirit of man, cannot be freed.
When Death Calls - Heaven is closer
When Death Calls - Feel the heat of the flames from the souls of the dying
When Death Calls - here it comes, here it comes, here it comes
When Death Calls - You're gonna burn
Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister
Can't die until Satan says you die
And Satan takes your soul
In the face of death or your toungue will blister
Don't look in those sunken eyes
Don't look and you'll stay alive
Don't laugh at the face of death or your toungue will blister
Can't die until Satan says you die
The Devil takes your soul
With all his wrath he calls the reaper

When Death Calls - The spirit of man cannot be freed
When Death Calls - There's no tomorrow
When Death Calls - Just an evil shadow

Who Are You?	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/who_are_you-lyrics-7162.html	Sabbath Bloody Sabbath	"Yes I know the secret
That's within your mind
You think all the people
Who worship you are blind
You're just like Big Brother
Giving us your trust
And when you have played enough
You'll just cast our souls
Into the dust
Into the dust
You thought that it would be easy
from the very start
Now I've found you out
I don't think you're so smart
I only have one more question
Before my time is through
Please I beg you tell me
In the name of hell
Who are you?
Who are you?"
Wicked World	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/wicked_world-lyrics-7127.html	Black Sabbath	"The world today is such a wicked thing
Fighting going on between the human race
People give good wishes to all their friends
While people just across the sea are counting the dead
A politician's job they say is very high
For he has to choose who's got to go and die
They can put a man on the moon quite easy
while people here on earth are dying of old diseases
A woman goes to work every day after day
She just goes to work just to earn her pay
Child sitting crying by a life that's harder
he doesn't even know who is his father"
Wishing Well	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/black_sabbath/wishing_well-lyrics-104193.html	Heaven Hell	"Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream

Then think of a rainbow and I'll make it come real
Roll me, I'm a never ending wheel
I'll give you a star
So you know just where you are
Don't you know that I might be
Your wishing well
Your wishing well
Look in the water, tell me what do you see
Reflections of the love you give to me
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy
So let me fill myself with tears you cry, why?
Time is a never ending journey
Love is a never ending smile
Give me a sign to build a dream on
Dream on...
Yeah, Throw me a penny and I'll make you a dream
You find that life's not always what it seems, no no
Love isn't money, it's not something you buy
So let me fill myself with tears you cry
I'll give you a star
So you know just where you are
Someday, some way, you'll feel the things I say
Dream for a while
Of the things that make you smile
'Cause you know
Don't you know
Oh, you know
That I'm your wishing well
Your wishing well
Your wishing well
I wish you well
I'm your wishing well"

Nobody will ever change my ways
I don't need money and I don't need no lies
I only need to live for today
But I'd like to talk things over with you
I want to hear the things you say, today
Although you won't change my anyway, no no way
I wish you'd come and see me, I'd like to hold you
I want to set my mind all free
You understand me woman, you give me time
But I don't need no sympathy
Still I wonder what it's like to be loved
Instead of hiding in myself
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way
Nobody's gonna change my world
That's something too unreal
Nobody will change the way I feel
So listen to me now, hear what I say
Please give me time and maybe love
If there's a God up there, well I hope he helps me
I need him now to set me free
'Cause it may be that it's over for me
If you don't hear the things that I say, today
Nobody will change me anyway, no no way
Nobody's gonna change my world, that's something too unreal
Nobody will change the way I feel"

It's all served up on a gold plated plate
And we don't even have to talk to you
Your face is normal, that's the way you're bred
And that's the way you're going to stay
Your head is firmly nailed to your TV channel
But someone else's finger's on the control panel

Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother

When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother

You sit there watch it all burn down
It's easy and breezy for you
You play your life to a different sound
No edge no edge you got no knife have you
Your life is a six-lane highway to nowhere
You're going so fast you're never ever gonna get down there
Where the heroes sit by the river
With a magic in their music as they eat raw liver
What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother
Zero the Hero
Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother
Zero the Hero
When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother
Zero the Hero
Impossibility impissibolity mother
Really a Hero
You stand there captain we all look, you really are mediocre
You are the champion in the Acme form book
But I think you're just a joker
Your facedown life ain't so much of a pity
But the luv-a-duckin' way you're walkin' around the city
With your balls and your head full of nothing
It's easy for you sucker but you really need stuffing
What you gonna be, what you gonna be brother

Don't you wanna be, don't you wanna be brother
Zero the Hero
When you gonna be, when you gonna be brother
