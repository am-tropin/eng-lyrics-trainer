Beneficial Herbs	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/kasabian/beneficial_herbs-lyrics-982276.html	-	"See the storm come
See the changing weather
Oh she says never as I
Throw my thoughts far away
Keep it down now
For a lying summer
Oh I got troubles and this
Paranoia won't let me awake
Oh can anyone help, help me?
Can anyone help, help me?
Wanna leave now
For science fiction's choking on addiction and
Gotta believe me
I wanna rest
Wait and
You have got to say
No one here is free
Oh can anyone help, help me?
Can anyone help, help me?
Can anyone help, help me?
Can anyone help, help me?
Oh"
Club Foot	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/kasabian/club_foot-lyrics-488740.html	Album: Kasabian	"One...take control of me
You're messing with the enemy
Said its 2, it's another trick
Messin with my mind, I wake up
Chase down an empty street
Blindly snap the broken beats
Said it's gone with the dirty trick
It's taken all these days to find ya
I tell you I want you
I tell you I need you
Friends, take control of me
Stalking cross' the gallery
All these pills got to operate
The colour quits and all invade us
There it goes again
Take me to the edge again
All I got is a dirty trick
I'm chasin down all walls to save ya
I tell you I want you
I'll tell you I need you
I... the blood ain't on my face
Just wanted you near me
I tell you I want you
I'll tell you I need you
The blood ain't on my hands
Just wanted you near me"
Cutt Off	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/kasabian/cutt_off-lyrics-488735.html	Album: Kasabian	"John was a scientist, he was hooked on LSD
Interested in mind control and how the monkey held the key
Said that all of his experiments are what he's planning for the air
It's for the unsuspecting citizens who hallucinate in fear
Sing that
Ah, ah-ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah ah
To the backbone, a solar system, he's never come back, so
Ah, ah-ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah ah
To the backbone, a solar system, he's never come back, so
And then at Union Station, with a package in his hand
Tied to the suspect, and chancing where he stand
And I don't think you realise he's coming for your neck
And the sound is breaking all around
He's keeping lives in check
Ah, ah-ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah ah
To the backbone, a solar system, he's never come back, so
Ah, ah-ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah ah
To the backbone, a solar system, he's never come back, so
Making his getaway through a punched-up mirror
He blend into the crowd
Hear the system scream
And all those spies that strikes your hip
Are clinging to their guns
And if you smell those almonds, man, I think you better run
Checkout
Ah, ah-ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah ah
John was a scientist, he was hooked on LSD
Ah, ah-ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah ah
Interested in mind control and how the monkey held the key
Ah, ah-ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah ah
To the backbone, a solar system, he's never come back, so
Ah, ah-ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah ah
To the backbone, a solar system, he's never come back, so
Ah, ah-ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah ah
To the backbone, a solar system, he's never come back, so
Ah, ah-ah-ah ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah ah
To the backbone, a solar system, he's never come back, so"
Empire	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/kasabian/empire-lyrics-902781.html	Album: Empire	"Too much information
Well I said you're good for nothing
Come on to the back
I said your needless good for something
Guess I'd better sell you now
Guess I'll bet I'll be around
Singing for your questions
But you've stolen all of my answers
Too much entertainment drove
my knights out of their corner
Tell me that you've seen a ghost
I'll tell you what to fear the most
Stop!
I said it's happening again!
We're all wasting away!
We're all wasting away!
Too much information
Well I said you're good for nothing
Stitch your part of counterfeit
I sent you out for hunting
Taking at the roads
Where you're taken for the simple codes
Swimming with the fishes
While the serpent waves his tongue
With a belly full of splinters
Now you see that I'm the one
Tell me that you've seen a ghost
I'll tell you what to fear the most
Stop!
I said it's happening again!
We're all wasting away!
We're all wasting away!"
Processed Beats	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/kasabian/processed_beats-lyrics-488739.html	Album: Kasabian	"I ran from the tide
Won't let you hide
Won't let you hide
I drop beats from this processed meat
For a conversation, a meditation and
I cut waves like some unborn sage
Just like terrorists on a day of rest singing
I ran from the tide
Won't let you hide
Won't let you hide
I break bones stealing mobile phones
And I'm cuttin deals for these homeless meals
Making idle threats using chinese burns
As you load my head with the Grateful Dead singing
I ran from the tide
Won't let you hide
Won't let you hide
I ran from the tide
Won't let you hide
Won't let you hide"
Test Transmission	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/kasabian/test_transmission-lyrics-651149.html	Album: Kasabian	"Verse 1
Standing here on this burning bridge
Trying to figure out but there's nothing here
Seem like they got the fear
Cattle grids rattle gold chains pay it back
Just cancel the chickens
And tell your son that he should steal the gold
Chorus 1
The kings send their knights
Check these soul satellites
Test transmission
Is calling me back home(x2)
Verse 2
To messed up to perform this cant you see ill only miss you now and memories
They get washed to the seas
Feeding tape through the fabric must tune in
Unless you're trapped tomorrow
And get out the sun, get out before it gets you back
Chorus 2
The kings send their knights
Check there souls satellites
Test transmission
Is calling me back home(x2)"
