A Feast Of Friends	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/a_feast_of_friends-lyrics-827905.html	An American Prayer	"Wow, I'm sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
South
Cruel bindings.
The servants have the power
dog-men and their mean women
pulling poor blankets over
our sailors
I'm sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the TV
Tower, I want roses in
my garden bower; dig?
Royal babies, rubies
must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
for the plant that's plowed.
They are waiting to take us into
the severed garden
Do you know how pale and wanton thrillful
comes death on a strange hour
unannounced, unplanned for
like a scaring over-friendly guest you've
brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all
and gives us wings
where we had shoulders
smooth as raven's
claws
No more money, no more fancy dress
This other kingdom seems by far the best
until it's other jaw reveals incest
and loose obedience to a vegetable law.
I will not go
Prefer a Feast of Friends
To the Giant Family."
A Little Game	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/a_little_game-lyrics-448761.html	Absolutely Live	"Once I had a little game
I liked to crawl back in my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called 'go insane'
Now you should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world, forget the people
And we'll erect a different steeple.
This little game is fun to do.
Just close your eyes, no way to lose.
And I'm right here, I'm going too.
Release control, we're breaking through."

He sides with Death
I straddle the fence
And my balls hurt"

American Night	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/american_night-lyrics-60584.html	An American Prayer	"All hail the American night!
What was that?
I don't know
Sounds like guns...thunder.
...Alright! Alright! Alright!
Hey, listen! Listen! Listen, man! listen, man!
I don't know how many you people believe in astrology...
Yeah, that's right...that's right, baby, I...I am a
Sagittarius
The most philosophical of all the signs
But anyway, I don't believe in it
I think it's a bunch of bullshit, myself
But I tell you this, man, I tell you this
I don't know what's gonna happen, man, but I wanna have
My kicks before the whole shithouse goes up in flames
Alright!"
An American Prayer	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/an_american_prayer-lyrics-258847.html	The Doors	"[I]
Do you know the warm progress under the stars?
Do you know we exist?
Have you forgotten the keys to the Kingdom?
Have you been borne yet & are you alive?
Let's reinvent the gods, all the myths of the ages
Celebrate symbols from deep elder forests
[Have you forgotten the lessons of the ancient war]
We need great golden copulations
The fathers are cackling in trees of the forest
Our mother is dead in the sea
Do you know we are being led to slaughters by placid admirals
& that fat slow generals are getting obscene on young blood
Do you know we are ruled by T.V.
The moon is a dry blood beast
Guerilla bands are rolling numbers in the next block of green vine
Amassing for warfare on innocent herdsmen who are just dying
O great creator of being grant us one more hour to perform our art & perfect our lives
The moths & atheists are doubly divine & dying
We live, we die & death not ends it
Journey we more into the Nightmare
Cling to life our passion'd flower
Cling to cunts & cocks of despair
We got our final vision by clap
Columbus' groin got filled w/ green death
(I touched her thigh & death smiled)
We have assembled inside this ancient & insane theatre
To propagate our lust for life & flee the swarming wisdom of the streets
The barns are stormed
The windows kept & only one of all the rest
To dance & save us
W/ the divine mockery of words
Music inflames temperament
(When the true King's murderers are allowed to roam free a 1000 magicians arise in the land)
Where are the feasts
We were promised
Where is the wine
The New Wine
(dying on the vine)
Resident mockery give us an hour for magic
We of the purple glove
We of the starling flight & velvet hour
We of arabic pleasure's breed
We of sundome & the night
Give us a creed
To believe
A night of Lust
Give us trust in
The Night
Give of color
Hundred hues
A rich Mandala
For me & you & for your silky pillowed house
A head, wisdom & a bed
Troubled decree
Resident mockery
Has claimed thee
We used to believe in the good old days
We still receive In little ways
The Things of Kindness & unsporting brow
Forget & allow
Did you know freedom exists in a school book
Did you know madmen are running our prison
W/in a jail, w/in a gaol, w/in a white free protestant
Maelstrom
We're perched headlong
On the edge of boredom
We're reaching for death
On the end of a candle
We're trying for something
That's already found us
We can invent Kingdoms of our own
Grand purple thrones, those chairs of lust
& love we must, in beds of rust
Steel doors lock in prisoner's screams
& muzak, AM, rocks their dreams
No black men's pride to hoist the beams
While mocking angels sift what seems
To be a collage of magazine dust
Scratched on foreheads of walls of trust
This is just jail for those who must
Get up in the morning & fight for such unusable standards
While weeping maidens show-off penury & pout ravings for a mad staff
Wow, I'm sick of doubt
Live in the light of certain
South
Cruel bindings
The servants have the power dog-men & their mean women
Pulling poor blankets over our sailors
(& where were you in our lean hour)
Milking your moustache?
Or grinding a flower?
I'm sick of dour faces
Staring at me from the T.V.
Tower. I want roses in my garden bower; dig?
Royal babies, rubies must now replace aborted
Strangers in the mud
These mutants, blood-meal
For the plant that's plowed
They are waiting to take us into the severed garden
Do you know how pale & wanton thrillful
Comes death on strange hour
Unannounced, unplanned for like a scaring over-friendly guest you've brought to bed
Death makes angels of us all & gives us wings where we had shoulders smooth as raven's claws

[II]
Great screaming Christ
Upsy-daisy
Lazy Mary will get you up upon a Sunday morning
""The movie will begin in 5 moments""
The mindless Voice announced
""All those unseated, will await The next show""
We filed slowly, languidly into the hall. The auditorium was vast, & silent.
As we seated & were darkened
The Voice continued:
""The program for this evening is not new. You have seen This entertainment thru & thru.
You've seen your birth, your life & death; you might recall all of the rest
- (did you have a good world when you died?) - enough to base a movie on?""
An iron chuckle rapped our minds like a fist.
I'm getting out of here
Where're you going?
To the other side of the morning
Please don't chase the clouds
Pagodas, temples
Her cunt gripped him
Like a warm friendly hand.
""It's all right.
All your friends are here.""
When can I meet them?
""After you've eaten""
I'm not hungry
""O, we meant beaten""
Silver stream, silvery scream,
Impossible concentration
Here come the comedians
Look at them smile
Watch them dance
An indian mile
Look at them gesture
How aplomb
So to gesture everyone
Words dissemble
Words be quick
Words resemble walking sticks
Plant them
They will grow
Watch them waver so
I'll always be
A word-man
Better than a birdman
But I'll charge
Won't get away
W/out lodging a dollar
Shall I say it again
Aloud, you get the point
No food w/out fuel's gain
I'll be, the irish loud
Unleashed my beak
At peak of powers
O girl, unleash
Your worried comb
O worried mind
Sin in the fallen
Backwoods by the blind
She smells debt
On my new collar
Arrogant prose
Tied in a network of fast quest
Hence the obsession
Its quick to admit
Fats borrowed rhythm
Woman came between them
Women of the world unite
Make the world safe
For a scandalous life
Hee Heee
Cut your throat
Life is a joke
Your wife's in a moat
The same boat
Here comes the goat
Blood Blood Blood Blood
They're making a joke
Of our universe
[III]
Matchbox
Are you more real than me
I'll burn you, & set you free
Wept bitter tears
Excessive courtesy
I won't forget
[IV]
A hot sick lava flowed up,
Rustling & bubbling.
The paper-face.
Mirror-mask, I love you mirror.
He had been brainwashed for 4 hrs.
The LT. puzzled in again
""ready to talk""
""No sir"" - was all he'd say.
Go back to the gym.
Very peaceful
Meditation
Air base in the desert
Looking out venetian blinds
A plane
A desert flower
Cool cartoon
The rest of the World
Is reckless & dangerous
Look at the
Brothels
Stag films
Exploration
[V]
A ship leaves port
Mean horse of another thicket
Wishbone of desire
Decry the metal fox"

Angels And Sailors	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/angels_and_sailors-lyrics-60588.html	An American Prayer	"Angels and sailors
Rich girls
Backyard fences
Tents
Dreams watching each other narrowly
Soft luxuriant cars
Girls in garages, stripped
Out to get liquor and clothes
Half gallons of wine and six-packs of beer
Jumped, humped, born to suffer
Made to undress in the wilderness.
I will never treat you mean
Never start no kind of scene
I'll tell you every place and person that I've been.
Always a playground instructor, never a killer
Always a bridesmaid on the verge of fame or over
He manouvered two girls into his hotel room
One a friend, the other, the young one, a newer stranger
Vaguely Mexican or Puerto Rican
Poor boys thighs and buttock scarred by a father's belt
She's trying to rie
Story of her boyfriend, of teenage stoned death games
Handsome lad, dead in a car
Confusion
No connections
Come 'ere
I love you
Peace on earth
Will you die for me?
Eat me
This way
The end
I'll always be true
Never go out, sneaking out on you, babe
If you'll only show me Far Arden again.
I'm surprised you could get it up
He whips her lightly, sardonically, with belt
Haven't I been through enough? she asks
Now dressed and leaving
The Spanish girl begins to bleed
She says her period
It's Catholic heaven
I have an ancient Indian crucifix around my neck
My chest is hard and brown
Lying on stained, wretched sheets with a bleeding virgin
We could plan a murder
Or start a religion."

black polished chrome
And came over the summer
like liquid night.
The DJ's took pills to stay awake
and play for seven days
They went to the studio
And someone knew him
Someone knew the TV showman
He came to our homeroom party
and played records
And when he left in the hot noon sun
and walked to his car
We saw the chooks had written
F-U-C-K on his windshield
He wiped it off with a rag
and smiling coolly drove away
He's rich. Got a big car.
My gang will get you
Scenes of rape in the arroyo
Seduction in cars, abandoned buildings
Fights at the food stand
The dust
the shoes
Open shirts and raised collars
Bright sculptured hair.
Hey man, you want girls, pills, grass? C'mon...
I show you good time.
This place has everything. C'mon...
I show you."

So limitless and free
Desperately in need...of some...stranger's hand
In a...desperate land
Lost in a Roman...wilderness of pain

Weird scenes inside the gold mine
Ride the highway west, baby
Ride the snake, ride the snake
To the lake, the ancient lake, baby
The snake is long, seven miles
Ride the snake...he's old, and his skin is cold
The west is the best
The west is the best
Get here, and we'll do the rest

The blue bus is callin' us
Driver, where you taken' us

He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down the hall
He went into the room where his sister lived, and...then he
Paid a visit to his brother, and then he
He walked on down the hall, and
And he came to a door...and he looked inside
Father, yes son, I want to kill you
Mother...I want to...fuck you
C'mon baby, take a chance with us
C'mon baby, take a chance with us
C'mon baby, take a chance with us

The end of nights we tried to die

Weird bate-headed mongrels
I keep expecting one of you to rise
Large buxom obese queen
Garden hogs and cunt veterans
Quaint cabbage saints
Shit hoarders and individualists
Drag strip officials
Tight lipped losers and
Lustful fuck salesman
My militant dandies
All strange orders of monsters
Hot on the tail of the woodvine
We welcome you to our procession
Here come the Comedians
look at them smile
Watch them dance an Indian mile
Look at them gesture
How aplomb
So to gesture everyone
Words dissemble
Words be quick
Words resemble walking sticks
Plant them they will grow
Watch them waver so
I'll always be a word man
Better then a bird man"
Dawn's Highway	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/dawns_highway-lyrics-60592.html	An American Prayer	"Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.
Me and my -ah- mother and father - and a
Grandmother and a grandfather - were driving through
The desert, at dawn, and a truck load of Indian
Workers had either hit another car, or just - I don't
Know what happened - but there were Indians scattered
All over the highway, bleeding to death.
So the car pulls up and stops. That was the first time
I tasted fear. I musta' been about four - like a child is
Like a flower, his head is just floating in the
Breeze, man.
The reaction I get now thinking about it, looking
Back - is that the souls of the ghosts of those dead
Indians...maybe one or two of 'em...were just
Running around freaking out, and just leaped into my
Soul. And they're still in there.
Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind.
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Phantastic L.A.
Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth if a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union
Blood on the rise, it's following me.
Indian, Indian what did you die for?
Indian says, nothing at all."

Although I still had not found a wife
I had my friends
Right there beside me.
We were close together.
We tripped the wall and we scaled the graveyard
Ancient shapes were all around us.
The wet dew felt fresh beside the fog.
Two made love in an ancient spot
One chased a rabbit into the dark
A girl got drunk and balled the dead
And I gave empty sermons to my head.
Cemetary, cool and quiet
Hate to leave your sacred lay
Dread the milky coming of the day."

Hello, I love you, won't you tell me your name.
Hello, I love you, let me jump in your game.
She holds her head so high
Like a statue in the sky.
Her arms are wicked and her legs are long
When she moves, my brain screams out this song.
Sidewalk crouches at her feet
Like a dog that begs for something sweet.
Do you hope to make her see, you fool?
Do you hope to pluck this dusky jewel?
Hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello, hello
I want you
I need my baby, yeah."
Horse Latitudes	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/horse_latitudes-lyrics-26377.html	Strange Days	"When the still sea conspires an armor
And her sullen and aborted
Currents breed tiny monsters
True sailing is dead
Awkward instant
And the first animal is jettisoned
Legs furiously pumping
Their stiff green gallop
And heads bob up
Poise
Delicate
Pause
Consent
In mute nostril agony
Carefully refined
And sealed over"

Sweet lies don´t gimme no rise
Oh, oh what you´re trying to do?
Livin´ on your cheatin´
and the pain grows inside me
It´s enough to leave me crying in the rain
Love you forever but you´re
driving me insane
and I´m hanging on
Oh, oh, I´ll win, I´ll never give in
Our love has got the power
Too many lovers in one lifetime
ain´t good for you
You treat me like a vision in the night
Someone there to stand behind you
When your world ain´t working right
I ain´t no vision, I am the man
who loves you inside out
backwards and forwards with
my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Wrap myself up and take me home again
Too many heartaches in one
lifetime ain´t good for me
I figure it´s the love that keeps you warm
Let this moment be forever
we won´t ever feel the storm
I ain´t no vision, I am the man
who loves you inside out
backwards and forwards with
my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?
Don´t try to tell me it´s all over
I can´t hear a word I can´t hear a line
No man could love you more
And that´s what I´m cryin´ for
You can´t change the way I feel inside
You´re the reason for my laughter and my sorrow
Blow out the candle I will burn again tomorrow
No man on earth can stand
between my love and I
And no matter how you hurt me
I will love you till I die
I ain´t no vision, I am the man
who loves you inside out
backwards and forwards with
my heart hanging out
I love no other way
What am I gonna do if we lose that fire?"

Sore and crucified
I seek to know you
Aquiring soulful wisdom
You can open walls of mystery
Stripshow
How to aquire death in the morning show
TV death which the child absorbs
Deathwell mystery which makes me write
Slow train, the death of my cock gives life
Forgive the poor old people who gave us entry
Taught us god in the child's praye in the night
Guitar player
Ancient wise satyr
Sing your ode to my cock
Caress it's lament
Stiffen and guide us, we frozen
Lost cells
The knowledge of cancer
To speak to the heart
And give the great gift
Words Power Trance
This stable friend and the beast of his zoo
Wild haired chicks
Women flowering in their summit
Monsters of skin
Each color connects
To create the boat
Which rocks the race
Could any hell be more horrible
Than now
And real?
I touched her thigh and death smiled
Death, old friend
Death and my cock are the world
I can forgive my injuries in the name of
Wisdom Luxury Romance
Sentence upon sentence
Words are the healing lament
For the death of my cock's spirit
Has no meaning in the soft fire
Words got me the wound and will get me well
I you believe it
All join now and lament the death of my cock
A tounge of knowledge in the feathered night
Boys get crazy in the head and suffer
I sacrifice my cock on the alter of silence"

Got to find my shipmates and walk on foreign sands""
This old man was graceful with silver in his smile
He smoked a briar pipe and he walked four country miles
Singing songs of shady sisters and old time liberty
Songs of love and songs of death and songs to set men free
Ya!
I've got three ships and sixteen men
A course for ports unread
I'll stand at mast, let north winds blow till half of us are dead
Land ho!
Well, if I get my hands on a dollar bill gonna buy a bottle and drink my fill
If I get my hands on a number five gonna skin that litlle girl alive
If I get my hand on a number two come back home and marry you
Marry you, marry you

black polished chrome
And came over the summer
like liquid night.
The DJ's took pills to stay awake
and play for seven days
They went to the studio
And someone knew him
Someone knew the TV showman
He came to our homeroom party
and played records
And when he left in the hot noon sun
and walked to his car
We saw the chooks had written
F-U-C-K on his windshield
He wiped it off with a rag
and smiling cooly drove away
He's rich. Got a big car.
My gang will get you
Scenes of rape in the arroyo
Seduction in cars, abandoned buildings
Fights at the food stand
The dust
the shoes
Open shirts and raised collars
Bright sculptured hair.
Hey man, you want girls, pills, grass? C'mon...
I show you good time.
This place has everything. C'mon...

Two made love in an ancient spot
One chased a rabbit into the dark
A girl got drunk and balled the dead
And I gave empty sermons to my head.

Hate to leave your sacred lay
Dread the milky coming of the day.

With a strange creature groaning beside him.

Are white in France?
Did you know women wear underpants?
Well, they do!
How does a musician imitate
The sound of underpants sliding
Over a woman's thighs,
Down over her ankles,
And over her little toes?
And the rings on her toes?
And her unquipped toe nails?
Lightning struck the magic purse
I didn't do a damn thing, man!
I was just standing there
In front of the 'Delicatessen'
And all these rabbies ran up
And a bunch of Indians and freaks
And monsters and f.... just started ...
Mhmh... talking in all these weird languages...
What aah ... what ... could I say?
Hey, I'm tired of being a freaky musician
I wanna be Napoleon!
Let's have some more wars around here!
What a stinking, shitty little war we have running over there
Let's get a big one!
A real big one!
With a lotta killings and bombs and blood!
Schooldays...
Schooldays...
Good old-fashioned rule days...

The assassination occurred at 3.30

And we were all silenced
by the sad mildew cloud
that followed around
I wish I was back in the land of the...

Aaahm uhm...
You can't pin that one on me
I didn't do a goddamn thing

Now what am I supposed to do?
I'm an American! You can't touch me!

Penetrate the evenin' that the

Let's swim out tonight, love
It's our turn to die
Parked beside the ocean
On our moonlight drive

But I can't be your guide

Falling through wet forests

Down, down by the ocean side
Gonna get real close
Get real tight

Goin' down, down, down, down
Goin' down
Goin' down, way down
Down, down, down, down, down
Down, baby low
Children of the caves will let the
Secret fires glow
When the still sea conspires an armor
And her sullen and aborted
Currents breed tiny monsters,
True sailing is dead.
Awkward instant
And the first animal is jettisoned,
Legs furiously pumping
Their stiff green gallop,
And head bob up
Poise
Delicate
Pause
Consent
In mute nostril agony
Carefully refined
And sealed over.
Easy, to love you
As I watch you glide
Yeah, we're falling through wet forests
On our moonlight drive
Moonlight drive
Moonlight drive
Moonlight drive
Thank you, thank you!"

She rode all the day
She wrote to the devil
And asked him to pay
The devil was wiser
It's time to repent
He asked her to give back
The money she spent
My wild love went ridin'
She rode to the sea
She gathered together
Some shells for her head
She rode and she rode on
She rode for a while
Then stopped for an evenin'
And lay her head down
She rode on to Christmas
She rode to the farm
She rode to Japan
And we entered a town
By this time the river
Had changed one degree
She asked for the people
To let her go free
My wild love is crazy
She screams like a bird
She moans like a cat
When she wants to be heard
My wild love went ridin'
She rode for an hour
She rode and she rested
And then she rode on
Ride, c'mon"

The dead are newborn awakening
With ravaged limbs and wet souls
Gently they sigh in rapt funeral amazement
Who called these dead to dance?
Was it the young woman learning to play the ghost song on her baby grand?
Was it the wilderness children?
Was it the ghost god himself, stuttering, cheering, chatting blindly?
I called you up to anoint the earth
I called you to announce sadness falling like burned skin
I called you to wish you well
To glory in self like a new monster
And now I call you to pray"

Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs

The engine runs on glue and tar
Come on along, not goin' very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me

The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road

Ya, c'mon!
We should see the gates by mornin'
We should be inside the evenin'

She was hardly there

Just the same.
There was rain in our window,
The FM set was ragged
But she could talk, yeah,
We learned to speak
And one year
Has gone by
Such a long long road to seek it
All we did was break and freak it
We had all
That lovers ever had
We just blew it
And I'm not sad
Well I'm mad
And I'm bad
And two years
Have gone by
Now her world was bright orange
And the fire glowed
And her friend had a baby
And she lived with us
Yeah, we broke through the window
Yeah, we knocked on the door
Her phone would not answer,
Yeah, but she's still home
Now her father has passed over
And her sister is a star
And her mother smokes diamonds
And she sleeps out in the car
Yeah, but she remembers Chicago
The musicians & guitars
And grass by the lake
And people who laugh'd
And made her poor heart ache
Now we live down in the valley
We work out on the farm
We climb up to the mountains
And everything's fine
And I'm still here
And you're still there
And we're still around"

And all night long you could hear me scream!
When you look all around, can you believe the shape she's in?
When you look all around, can you believe the shape she's in?
Look all around, can you believe the shape she's in?
Know where I'm goin', can't remember where I've been
Know right where I'm goin', can't remember where I've been

Once I was young now I'm gettin' old
Once I was warm, now I feel cold

She came and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
She came
Blood in the streets runs a river of sadness
She came
Blood in the streets it's up to my thigh
She came
Yeah the river runs red down the legs of a city
She came
The women are crying red rivers of weepin'
She came into town and then she drove away
Sunlight in her hair
Indians scattered on dawn's highway bleeding
Ghosts crowd the young child's fragile eggshell mind
Blood in the streets in the town of New Haven
Blood stains the roofs and the palm trees of Venice
Blood in my love in the terrible summer
Bloody red sun of Phantastic L.A.
Blood screams her brain as they chop off her fingers
Blood will be born in the birth of a nation
Blood is the rose of mysterious union

We had some good times.
We had a few good times.
But
Those good little times - you know where they are ?
They're absolutely, positively under the ground.
And
As long as I got breath, the death of rock
Is the death of me,
And rock is dead
Well, we're dead... alright... yeah !...
Rock Is Dead"
Runnin' Blue	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/runnin_blue-lyrics-26400.html	The Soft Parade	"Poor Otis dead and gone
Left me here to sing his song
Pretty little girl with the red dress on
Poor Otis dead and gone
Yeah, back down, turn around slowly
Try it again, remembering when
It was easy, try it again
Much to easy, rememberin' when
All right, look at my shoes
Not quite the walkin' blues
Don't fight, too much to lose
Can't fight the runnin' blues Well, I've got the runnin' blues
Runnin' away, back to L.A.
Got to find the dock of the bay
Maybe find it back in L.A.
Runnin' scared
Runnin' blue
Goin' so fast
What'll I do
Well, I've got the runnin' blues
Runnin' away, back to L.A.
Got to find the dock of the bay
Maybe find it back in L.A.

Will you try, little try?
Please stop and you remember

You could lend to me

I know your moves and your mind
And your mind

Will you stop and think and wonder?
Just what you'll see
Out on the train yard
Nursin' penitentiary
It's gone, I cry out long
Go head, brother
Did you stop it to consider?
How it will feel
Cold, grinded grizzly bear jaws
Hot on your heels
Do you often stop and whisper?
It's Saturday's shore
The whole world's a savior
Who could ever, ever, ever
Ever, ever, ever
Ask for more?
Do you remember?
Will you stop?
Will you stop?
The pain
And there will never be
Another one like you
There will never be
Another one who can
Do the things you do, oh
Will you give another chance?
Will you try, little try?
Please stop and you remember
We were together, anyway, all right
How you must of think and wondered
How I must feel
Out on the meadows
While you run the field
I'm alone for you
And I cry
The sweat, look at it
Optical promise
Heh, heh, heh
You'll be dead and in hell
Before I'm born
Sure thing
Brides maid
The only solution
Isn't it amazing?"

Familiar freaks will fill your living room
Rugs lash out with their lizard tongues, you're not getting young
You're not getting young
And I hate to remind you but you're going to die
All by yourself in the infancy's lie
Someday soon, someday soon
Television bleeding like a harvest moon
Flush the scissors down the hole, you're getting old
You're getting old
And I hate to remind you but you're going to die
And you're going to be needing all of your lies
You'll be all alone when the animal's cry

The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes
Street lights share their hollow glow
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise
Still one place to go
Still one place to go
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget, learn to forget
Learn to forget, learn to forget
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind near your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
Well the clock says it's time to close now
I know I have to go now
I really want to stay here
All night, all night, all night"

Stoned Immaculate	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/stoned_immaculate-lyrics-60587.html	An American Prayer	"I'll tell you this...
No eternal reward will forgive us now
For wasting the dawn.
Back in those days everything was simpler and more confused
One summer night, going to the pier
I ran into two young girls
The blonde one was called Freedom
The dark one, Enterprise
We talked and they told me this story
Now listen to this...
I'll tell you about Texas radio and the big beat
Soft driven, slow and mad
Like some new language
Reaching your head with the cold, sudden fury of a divine messenger
Let me tell you about heartache and the loss of god
Wandering, wandering in hopless night
Out here in the perimeter there are no stars
Out here we is stoned
Immaculate."

Strange days have tracked us down
They're going to destroy
Our casual joys
We shall go on playing
Or find a new town
Yeah!
Strange eyes fill strange rooms
Voices will signal their tired end
The hostess is grinning
Her guests sleep from sinning
Hear me talk of sin
And you know this is it
Yeah!
Strange days have found us
And through their strange hours
We linger alone
Bodies confused
Memories misused
As we run from the day
To a strange night of stone"

The Celebration Of The Lizard	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/the_celebration_of_the_lizard-lyrics-258846.html	The Doors	"Lions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town
He went down South and crossed the border
Left the chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder
One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shiny skin
Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about to begin
Wake up!
You can't remember where it was
Had this dream stopped?
The snake was pale gold
Glazed and shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisons
Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look!
I can't live thru each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down
The cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain . . .
Once I had, a little game
I liked to crawl back into my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called 'go insane'
Now you should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world forget the people
And we'll erect a different steeple
This little game is fun to do
Just close your eyes no way to lose
And I'm right there I'm going too
Release control we're breaking thru
Way back deep into the brain
Back where there's never any pain
And the rain falls gently on the town
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of
Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around
Reptiles abounding
Fossils, caves, cool air heights
Each house repeats a mold
Windows rolled
Beast car locked in against morning
All now sleeping
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant
Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets
And daughters, smug
With semen eyes in their nipples
Wait
There's been a slaughter here
(Don't stop to speak or look around
Your gloves and fan are on the ground
We're getting out of town
We're going on the run
And you're the one I want to come
Not to touch the earth
Not to see the sun
Nothing left to do, but
Run, run, run
Let's run
House upon the hill
Moon is lying still
Shadows of the trees
Witnessing the wild breeze
C'mon baby run with me
Let's run
Run with me
Run with me
Run with me
Let's run
The mansion is warm, at the top of the hill
Rich are the rooms and the comforts there
Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs
And you won't know a thing till you get inside
Dead president's corpse in the driver's car
The engine runs on glue and tar
C'mon along, we're not going very far
To the East to meet the Czar
Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake
The minister's daughter's in love with the snake
Who lives in a well by the side of the road
Wake up, girl! We're almost home
Sun, sun, sun
Burn, burn, burn
Soon, soon, soon
Moon, moon, moon
I will get you
Soon!, Soon!, Soon!
Let the carnival bells ring
Let the serpent sing
Let everything
We came down
The rivers and highways
We came down from
Forests and falls
We came down from
Carson and Springfield
We came down from
Phoenix enthralled
And I can tell you
The names of the Kingdom
I can tell you
The things that you know
Listening for a fistful of silence
Climbing valleys into the shade
I am the Lizard King
I can do anything
I can make the earth stop in its tracks
I made the blue cars go away
For seven years I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile
Playing strange games
With the girls of the island
Now I have come again
To the land of the fair, and the strong, and the wise
Brothers and sisters of the pale forest
O Children of Night
Who among you will run with the hunt?
Now Night arrives with her purple legion
Retire now to your tents and to your dreams
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth
I want to be ready'"

Silverware being dropped on linoleum, and then
Somebody ran into the room and they said
""Have you seen the accident outside?""
And everybody said:
""Hey man, have you seen the accident outside?""
Have you seen the accident outside
Seven people took a ride
Six bachelors and their bride
Seven people took a ride
Sever people died
Don't let me die in an automobile
I wanna lie in an open field
Want the snakes to suck my skin
Want the worms to be my friends
Want the birds to eat my eyes
As here I lie
The clouds fly by
Ode to a grasshopper...
I think I'll open a little shop,
A little place where they sell things
And I think I'll call it ""Grasshopper""...
I have a big green grasshopper out there
Have you seen my grasshopper, mama?
Looking real good...
(Oh, I blew it, it's a moth)
That's alright, he ain't got long to go, so we'll forgive him.

Came to a door
He looked inside

I wanna hide behind a gravestone and watch them cry over me
I'm not normal, can't you fuckers see?
You're all a bunch of fuckin idiots!!!
Fuck florida, and fuck college, and fuck me!
Do you guys want to see it?
I'll show it to ya!!!

He put his snakeskin boots on!
He took a face from the ancient gallery
And he walked on down that hall, god damnit

and he walked inside her room, and he lay down on her bed
and he lay her on her back

The Ghost Song	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/the_ghost_song-lyrics-1029704.html	An American Prayer	"Awake.
Shake dreams from your hair
My pretty child, my sweet one.
Choose the day and choose the sign of your day
The day's divinity
First thing you see.
A vast radiant beach in a cool jeweled moon
Couples naked race down by it's quiet side
And we laugh like soft, mad children
Smug in the wooly cotton brains of infancy
The music and voices are all around us.
Choose they croon the Ancient Ones
The time has come again
Choose now, they croon
Beneath the moon
Beside an ancient lake
Enter again the sweet forest
Enter the hot dream
Come with us
Everything is broken up and dances."
The Hill Dwellers	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/the_hill_dwellers-lyrics-448754.html	Absolutely Live	"Way back deep into the brain
Way back past the realm of pain
Back where there's never any rain.
And the rain falls gently on the town,
And over the heads of all of us.
And in the labyrinth of streams
Beneath, quiet unearthly presence of
Nervous hill dwellers in the gentle hills around,
Reptiles abounding
Fossils, caves, cool air heights.
Each house repeats a mold
Windows rolled
A beast car locked in against morning.
All now sleeping
Rugs silent, mirrors vacant,
Dust blind under the beds of lawful couples
Wound in sheets.
And daughters, smug
With semen eyes in their nipples
Wait
There's been a slaughter here!"
The Hitchhiker	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/the_hitchhiker-lyrics-60581.html	An American Prayer	"Thoughts in time and out of season
The Hitchhiker
Stood by the side of the road
And leveled his thumb
In the calm calculus of reason
Hi. How you doin'? I just got back into town L.A.
I was out on the desert for awhile
""Riders on the storm""
Yeah. In the middle of it
""Riders on the storm""
Right...
""Into this world we're born""
Hey, listen, man, I really got a problem
""Into this world we're thrown""
When I was out on the desert, ya know
""Like a dog without a bone
An actor out on loan""
I don't know how to tell you
""Riders on the storm""
But, ah, I killed somebody
""There's a killer on the road""
No...
""His brain is squirming like a toad""
It's no big deal, ya know
I don't think anybody will find out about it, but...
"" take a long holiday""
Just, ah...
""Let your children play""
This guy gave me a ride, and ah...
""If you give this man a ride""
Started giving me a lot of trouble
""Sweet family will die""
And I just couldn't take it, ya know
""Killer on the road""
And I wasted him
Yeah"
The Movie	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/the_movie-lyrics-60586.html	An American Prayer	"The movie will begin in five moments
The mindless voice announced
All those unseated will await the next show.
We filed slowly, languidly into the hall
The auditorium was vast and silent
As we seated and were darkened, the voice continued.
The program for this evening is not new
You've seen this entertainment through and through
You've seen your birth your life and death
You might recall all of the rest
Did you have a good world when you died?
Enough to base a movie on?.
I'm getting out of here
Where are you going?
To the other side of morning
Please don't chase the clouds, pagodas
Her cunt gripped him like a warm, friendly hand.
It's alright, all your friends are here
When can I meet them?
After you've eaten
I'm not hungry
Uh, we meant beaten
Silver stream, silvery scream
Oooooh, impossible concentration."
The Palace Of Exile	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/the_palace_of_exile-lyrics-448753.html	Absolutely Live	"For seven years I dwelt
In the loose palace of exile,
Playing strange games
With the girls of the island.
Now I have come again
To the land of the fair, & the strong, & the wise.
Brothers & sisters of the pale forest
Children of Night
Who among you will run with the hunt?
Now Night arrives with her purple legion.
Retire now to your tents & to your dreams.
Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth.
I want to be ready.
The Doors! The Doors!
We're out of time, thank you very much. We're out of time.
All right, we've got time for one more, let's do it one more time."

live in the life of certain, south, cruel bindings
the servants have the power
dog men and theyre mean women
pulling poor blankets over our sailors
im sick of dour faces staring at me from the tv tower
i want roses in my garden bower, dig?
royal babies, rubies must now replace aborted strangers in the mud
these mutants blood meal, the plant thats ploughed
they are waiting to take us into the severed garden
you know how pale, wanton, thrillful comes death
in the strange hour
unannounced, unplanned for
like the scary over friendly guest you bought to bed
death makes angels of us all and gives us wings
where we had shoulders smooth as ravens claws
no more money, no more fancy dress
this other kingdom seems by far the best
until its other jaw reveals incest
and lose obedience to a vegetable
i will not go
prefer a feast of friends to the giant family"

And we'll erect a different steeple.
This little game is fun to do.
Just close your eyes, no way to lose.
And I'm right here, I'm going too.
Release control, we're breaking through."

Comes out of the Virginia swamps
Cool and slow with a back beat
Narrow and hard to master
Some call it heavenly in it's brilliance
Others, mean and ruthful of the Western dream
I love the friends I have gathered together on this thin raft
We've constructed pyramids in honor of our escaping
This is the land where the Pharaoh died
Children
The river contains specimens
The voices of singing women
Call us on the far shore
And they are saying
""Forget the Night
live with us in Forests of azure""
Meager food for souls forgot
I tell you this;
No eternal reward will
Forgive us now for
Wasting the dawn
One morning you awoke
And the strange sun
And opening your door..."

Don't go over the line. You better keep on time
Or you'll lose your mind on your tightrope ride
Watch out, don't fall! Careful, don't slip!
You better get your balance, you have to feel the way
There are no more questions, no answers today
There are no reasons, there are no more rhymes
But if you feel it, you can fly next time
You can fly next time, or maybe this time
Did you think we were all together?
Did you think we were all the same?
Did you think maybe I could help you
Remember your name, remember the game
What's the name of the game
It's a very good game, never stays the same
It's the number one from mud to sun
You're on a tightrope ride, we're all by your side
But you're all alone, and we're going home
And we're by your side, but you're all alone

On a tightrope ride"

To come of age in a dry place
Holes and caves.

Spades dance best, from the hip."

Glazed & shrunken.
We were afraid to touch it.
The sheets were hot dead prisons.
And she was beside me.
Old, she's numb.
Her dark, red hair,
The white soft skin.
Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom,
Look!
She's coming in here
I can't live thru each slow century of her moving.
I let my cheek slide down
The cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain..."

Cobra-snake for a necktie.
Built a house by the roadside,
Made of rattlesnake hide.
Brand new chimney up on top,
Made out of human skulls.
Come on baby take a walk with me,
Tell me who do you love?
Who do you love, now?
Who do you love, now?
Who do you love, babe?
I say: Who now, who do you love?
Tombstone head and a graveyard mind,
Just 22 and I don't mind dying.
Rode around the town with a rattlesnake whip,
Come on baby don't give me no lip.
Who do you love, now?
Who do you love?
Who do you love, child?
I said: Who, baby, who do you love?
Night is dark, the sky was blue,
Down the alley the ice wagon flew.
Hit a bump, somebody screamed,
Should'a heard just what I seen.
Do you love me, babe?
Do you love her, yeah
Do you love me, babe?
Do you love it, yeah

Who scared you and why were you born? Please stay.
I see your rider coming down the road.
Got a virgin carrying a heavy load,
One sack of silver and one bag of gold."
Wild Child	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/wild_child-lyrics-26399.html	The Soft Parade	"All right
Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face
Natural child, terrible child
Not your mother's or your father's child
Your our child, screamin' wild
An ancient rulage of grains
And the trees of the night
Ha, ha, ha, ha
With hunger at her heels
Freedom in her eyes
She dances on her knees
Pirate prince at her side
Stirrin' into a hollow idols eyes
Wild child full of grace
Savior of the human race
Your cool face
Your cool face
Your cool face
Do you remember when we were in Africa?"
Wintertime Love	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/wintertime_love-lyrics-26387.html	Waiting For The Sun	"Wintertime winds blow cold the season
Fallen in love, I'm hopin' to be
Wind is so cold, is that the reason?
Keeping you warm, your hands touching me
Come with me dance, my dear
Winter's so cold this year
You are so warm
My wintertime love to be
Winter time winds blue and freezin'
Comin' from northern storms in the sea
Love has been lost, is that the reason?
Trying desperately to be free
Come with me dance, my dear
Winter's so cold this year
And you are so warm
My wintertime love to be
La, la, la, la
Come with me dance, my dear
Winter's so cold this year
You are so warm
My wintertime love to be"

Water covers everything in blue
Coolin' water
Wishful sinful
Our love is beautiful to see
I know where I would like to be
Right back where I came
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue
Water covers you
Wishful, sinful, wicked you
Can't escape the blue
Magic risin'
Sun is shinin' deep beneath the sea
But not enough for you and me and sunshine
Love to hear the wind cry
Wishful sinful
Our love is beautiful to see
I know where I would like to be
Right back where I came
Wishful, sinful, wicked blue
Water covers you
Wishful, sinful, wicked you
Can't escape the blue
Love to hear the wind cry
Love to hear you cry, yeah, yeah"
Woman Is A Devil	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/doors/woman_is_a_devil-lyrics-783912.html	The Doors	"Me and the devil,
Walking side by side.
Me and the devil,
Going to take you on a long and evil ride.
The woman is a devil,
That's what I've been told.
Woman is a devil,
That's what I've been told.
She'll take all your money,
Then she'll spend all your gold.
All right.
The devil is a woman.
She's a woman.
Well I play my acts, honey
She take the whole damn role.
Keep on going, now, come on.
All right play it, yeah.
One more time.
Well she feel like dying.
Only twenty-one.
Well she feel like dying,
But she's only twenty-one.
She's not the only,
She's not the only one.
All right, all right, all right.
All right, all right.
Gonna save the whole world.
All right."
