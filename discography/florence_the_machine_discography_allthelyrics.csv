Addicted To Love	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/addicted_to_love-lyrics-1347575.html	-	"The lights are on, but you're not home
Your mind is not your own
Your heart sweats, your body shakes
Another kiss is what it takes
You can't sleep, you can't eat
There's no doubt, you're in deep
Your throat is tight, you can't breathe
Another kiss is all you need
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh Yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough,
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love
You see the signs, but you can't read
You're running at a different speed
Your heart beats in double time
Another kiss and you'll be mine,
A one-track mind, you can't be saved
Oblivion is all you crave
If there's some left for you
You don't mind if you do
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh Yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough,
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love [5x]
Your lights are on, but you're not home
Your will is not your own
Your heart sweats your teeth grind
Another kiss and you'll be mine
Whoa, you like to think that you're immune to the stuff, oh Yeah
It's closer to the truth to say you can't get enough,
You know you're gonna have to face it, you're addicted to love
Might as well face it, you're addicted to love [8x]"
All This And Heaven Too	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/all_this_and_heaven_too-lyrics-1370541.html	-	"[Florence]
And the heart is hard to translate,
It has a language of its own,
It talks and tongues and quiet sighs and prayers and proclamations,
In the grand days of great men and the smallest of gestures,
In short shallow gasps!
But with all my education,
I can't seem to commend it,
And the words are all escaping me,
And coming back all damaged,
And I would put them back in poetry,
If I only knew how,
I can't seem to understand it,
And I would give all this and heaven too,
I would give it all if only for a moment,
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see,
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever,
But it never makes sense to me at all.
And it talks to me in tiptoes,
And sings to me inside,
It cries out in the darkest night,
And breaks in morning light.
But with all my education,
I can't seem to commend it,
And the words are all escaping,
And coming back all damaged,
And I would put them back in poetry,
If I only knew how,
I can't seem to understand it,
And I would give all this and heaven too,
I would give it all if only for a moment,
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see,
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever,
But it never makes sense to me at all.
And I would give all this and heaven too,
I would give it all if only for a moment,
That I could just understand the meaning of the word you see,
'Cause I've been scrawling it forever,
But it never makes sense to me at all.
No, words are a language,
It doesn't deserve such treatment,
And all my stumbling phrases,
Never amounted to anything worth this feeling,
All this heaven,
Never could describe such a feeling as I'm having,
Words were never so useful,
So I was screaming out a language that I never knew existed before"
Between Two Lungs	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/between_two_lungs-lyrics-1315271.html	Album: Lungs	"Between two lungs it was released
The breath that captured me
The sigh that blew me forward
Because it was trapped
Trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs
And my running feet could fly
Each breath screaming: ""We are all too young to die!""
Between two lungs it was released
The breath that passed from you to me
That flew between us as we slept
That slipped from your mouth into mine
It crept between two lungs
It was released
The breath that passed from you to me
That flew between us as we slept
That slipped from your mouth into mine
It crept
Because it was trapped
Tapped between two lungs
It was trapped between two lungs
Gone all the days of begging
The days of theft
No more gasping for a breath
The air has filled me head-to-toe
And I can see the ground far below
I have this breath and I hold it tight
And I keep it in my chest with all my might
I pray to God this breath will last
As it pushes past my lips
As I...
GASP
Between two lungs it was released
The breath that passed from you to me
Hoo..."
Blinding	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/blinding-lyrics-1315270.html	Album: Lungs	"Seems that I have been held in some dreaming state
A tourist in the waking world, never quite awake
No kiss, no gentle word could wake me from this slumber
Until I realized that it was you who held me under
Felt it in my fist, in my feet, in the hollows of my eyelids
Shaking through my skull, through my spine and down through my ribs
No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world
And I could hear the thunder and see the lightning crack
All around the world was waking, I never could go back
'Cause all the walls of dreaming, they were torn wide open
And finally it seemed that the spell was broken
And all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open
And all my bones began to shake, my eyes flew open
No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world
Snow White's stitching like a circuitboard
It's like I'm slipping through the hidden door
Snow White's stitching like a circuitboard
No more dreaming of the dead as if death itself was undone
No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love with the wrong world
Snow White's stitching like a circuitboard
It's like I'm slipping through the hidden door
Snow White's stitching like a circuitboard
It's like I'm slipping through the hidden door"
Breaking Down	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/breaking_down-lyrics-1370535.html	-	"All alone
It was always there you see
And even on my own
It was always standing next to me
I can see it coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight
Holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down
All alone
Even when I was a child
I've always known
There was something to be find
You know that I can see you coming from the edge of the room
Creeping in the streetlight
Holding my hand in the pale gloom
Can you see it coming now?
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down
All alone
On the edge of sleep
My old familiar friend
Comes and lies down next to me
And I can see you coming from the edge of the room
Smiling in the streetlight
Even with my eyes shut tight
I still see you coming now
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down again
Oh, I think I'm breaking down"
Cosmic Love	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/cosmic_love-lyrics-1315269.html	Album: Lungs	"A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
I screamed aloud, as it tore through them, and now it's left me blind
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
And in the dark, I can hear your heartbeat
I tried to find the sound
But then, it stopped, and I was in the darkness,
So darkness I became
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
I took the stars from my eyes, and then I made a map
And knew that somehow I could find my way back
Then I heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too
So I stayed in the darkness with you
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
The stars, the moon, they have all been blown out
You left me in the dark
No dawn, no day, I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart"
Dog Days Are Over	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/dog_days_are_over-lyrics-1302133.html	Album: Lungs	"Happiness hit her like a train on a track
Coming towards her stuck still no turning back
She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble she sank with her drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your loving, your longing behind
You cant carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had and what was left after that too, oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Struck from a great height by someone who should know better than that
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your loving, your longing behind
You cant carry it with you if you want to survive
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
Can you hear the horses?
'Cause here they come
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run"
Drumming Song	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/drumming_song-lyrics-1315268.html	Album: Lungs	"There's a drumming noise inside my head
That starts when you're around
I swear that you could hear it
It makes such an all mighty sound
There's a drumming noise inside my head
that throws me to the ground
I swear that you should hear it
It makes such an all mighty sound
Louder than sirens
Louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven
And hotter than hell
I ran to a tower where the church bells chime
I hoped that they would clear my mind
They left a ringing in my ear
But that drum's still beating loud and clear
Louder than sirens
Louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven
And hotter than hell
Louder than sirens
Louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven
And hotter than hell
Louder than sirens
Louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven
And hotter than hell
As I move my feet towards your body
I can hear this beat it fills my head up
and gets louder and louder
it fills my head up and gets louder and louder
I run to the river and dive straight in
I pray that the water will drown out the din
But as the water fills my mouth
it couldn't wash the echoes out
But as the water fills my mouth
it couldn't wash the echoes out
I swallow the sound and it swallows me whole
Till there's nothing left inside my soul
As empty as that beating drum
But the sound has just begun
As I move my feet towards your body
I can hear this beat it fills my head up
and gets louder and louder
it fills my head up and gets louder and louder
There's a drumming noise inside my head
That starts when you're around
I swear that you could hear it
It makes such an all mighty sound
There's a drumming noise inside my head
That starts when you're around
I swear that you could hear it
It makes such an all mighty sound
Louder than sirens
Louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven
And hotter than hell
Louder than sirens
Louder than bells
Sweeter than heaven
And hotter than hell
As I move my feet towards your body
I can hear this beat it fills my head up
and gets louder and louder
it fills my head up and gets louder and louder"
Girl With One Eye	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/girl_with_one_eye-lyrics-1315267.html	Album: Lungs	"She told me not to step on the cracks
I told her not to fuss and relax
Well, her pretty little face stopped me in my tracks
But now she sleeps with one eye open
That's the price she paid
I took a knife and cut out her eye
I took it home and watched it wither and die
Well, she's lucky that I didn't slip her a smile
That's why she sleeps with one eye open
That's the price she paid
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out cause you made me cry
I slipped my hand under her skirt
I said don't worry, it's not gonna hurt
Oh, my reputation's kinda clouded with dirt
That's why you sleep with one eye open
That's the price you paid
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out cause you made me cry
You made me cry
You made me cry
You made me cry
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
Get your filthy fingers out of my pie
I said, hey, girl with one eye
I'll cut your little heart out cause you made me cry"
Heartlines	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/heartlines-lyrics-1370539.html	-	"[Florence]
Ohh the river, ohh the river, it's running free
And ohh the joy, ohh the joy it brings to me.
But I know it'll have to drown me,
Before it can breathe easy.
And I've seen it in the flights of birds,
I've seen it in you
The entrails of the animals,
The blood running through.
But in order to get to the heart,
I think sometimes you'll have to cut through
But you can't...
We will carry?
We will carry you there?
Just keep following!
The heartlines on your head!
Just keep following!
The heartlines on your head!
Keep it up!
I know you can!
Just keep following!
The heartlines on your head!
Cause I am?
On the sea, on the sea and land over land.
Creeping and crawling like the sea over sand.
Still I follow heartlines on your head.
And this fantasy, this fallacy, this tumbling stone.
Echoes of a city that's long overgrown.
Your heart is the only place that I call home,
Can I be returned?
You can?
We can?
I know you can?
Just keep following!
The heartlines on your head!
Just keep following!
The heartlines on your head!
Keep it up!
I know you can!
Just keep following!
The heartlines on your head!
What a thing to do?
Oooh
What a thing to choose?
But know, in some way I'm there with you.
Up against the wall on a Wednesday afternoon.
Just keep following!
The heartlines on your head!
Just keep following!
The heartlines on your head!
Keep it up!
I know you can!
Just keep following!
The heartlines on your head!
Cause I am"
Hurricane Drunk	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/hurricane_drunk-lyrics-1315265.html	Album: Lungs	"No walls
Can keep me protected
No sleep
Nothing in-between me and the rain
And you can't save me now
I'm in the grip of a hurricane
I'm gonna blow myself away
I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else
I brace myself
'cause I know it's going to hurt
But I like to think at least things can't get any worse
No home
I don't want shelter
No calm
Nothing to keep me from the storm
And you can't hold me down
'cause I belong to the hurricane
It's gonna blow us all away
I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else
I brace myself
'cause I know it's going to hurt
But I like to think at least things can't get any worse
I hope that you see me
'cause I'm staring at you
But when you look over
You look right through
Then you lean and kiss her on the head
And I never felt so alive, and so... dead
I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else
I brace myself
'cause I know it's going to hurt
I'm going out
I'm going out
I'm gonna drink myself to death
And in the crowd
I see you with someone else
I brace myself
'cause I know it's going to hurt
I'm going out

I'm going out

I'm going out

Just don't lie to me.
I'm not calling you a thief,
Just don't steal from me,
I'm not calling you a ghost,
Just stop haunting me,
And i love you so much,
I'm gonna let you,
Kill me.
There's a ghost in my lungs
And it sighs in my sleep,
Wraps itself around my tongue,
As it softly speaks
Then it walks, then it walks with my legs
To Fall,
To Fall,
To Fall, at your feet.
Oh but for the grace of god go on,
And when you kiss me, I'm happy enough to die.
I'm not calling you a liar,
Just don't lie to me.
And i love you so much,
I'm gonna let you
I'm not calling you a thief,
Just don't,
And i love you so much,
I'm gonna let you,
Ohh,
I'm not calling you a ghost,
Just don't
There's a ghost in my mouth
And it talks in my sleep,
Wraps itself around my tongue,
As it softly speaks
then it walks, then it walks
then it walks with my legs
To Fall,
To Fall,
To Fall,
To Fall,

To Fall, at your feet.

I hit you back
You gave a kick
I gave a slap
You smashed a plate over my head
Then I set fire to our bed
You hit me once
I hit you back
You gave a kick
I gave a slap
You smashed a plate over my head
Then I set fire to our bed
My black eye casts no shadow
Your red eye sees nothing
Your slap don't stick
Your kicks don't hit
So we remain the same
Love sticks
Sweat drips
Break the lock if it don't fit
A kick to the teeth is good for some
A kiss with a fist is better then none
A kiss with a fist is better then none
I broke your jaw once before
I spilled your blood upon the floor
You broke my leg in return
So sit back and watch the bed burn
Love sticks
Sweat drips
Break the lock if it don't fit
A kick in the teeth is good for some
A kiss with a fist is better then none
A kiss with a fist is better then none
You hit me once
I hit you back
You gave a kick
I gave a slap
You smashed a plate over my head
Then I set fire to our bed
You hit me once
I hit you back
You gave a kick
I gave a slap
You smashed a plate over my head

I've been losin' sleep,
I've been keepin' myself awake,
I've been wandering the streets,
For days and days and days,
Oh if I'm row to row,
Back to back,

And black to red,

There's no salvation for me now,
No space among the clouds,
And I've seen that I'm heading down,

I've been setting myself up for the fall,
I've been keeping secrets,
From my heart and from and from my soul.
Going from row to row,

My Boy Builds Coffins	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/my_boy_builds_coffins-lyrics-1315263.html	Album: Lungs	"My boy builds coffins with hammers and nails
He doesn't build ships, he has no use for sails
He doesn't make tables, dressers, or chairs
He can't carve a whistle 'cause he just doesn't care
My boy builds coffins for the rich and the poor
Kings and queens them all knocked on his door
Beggars and liars, gypsies and thieves
They all come to him 'cause he's so eager to please
My boy builds coffins he makes them all day
But it's not just for work and it isn't for play
He's made one for himself
One for me too
One of these days he'll make one for you
My boy builds coffins for better or worse
Some say it's a blessing, some say it's a curse
He fits them together in sunshine or rain
Each one is unique, no two are the same
My boy builds coffins and I think it's a shame
That when each one's been made, he can't see it again
He crafts every one with love and with care
Then it's thrown in the ground and it just isn't fair
My boy builds coffins he makes them all day
But it's not just for work and it isn't for play
He's made one for himself
One for me too
One of these days he'll make one for you"
Never Let Me Go	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/never_let_me_go-lyrics-1370534.html	Album: Ceremonials	"Looking up from underneath
Fractured moonlight light on the sea,
Reflections still look the same to me,
As before I went under
And it's peaceful in the deep,
Cause either way you cannot breathe,
No need to pray, no need to say
Now I am under
And it's breaking over me,
A thousand miles down to the sea bed,
I found the place to rest my head.
Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me,
And all this devotion was rushing out of me,
And the crashes are heaven, for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean deliver me.
Though the pressure's hard to take,
It's the only way I can escape,
It seems a heavy choice to make,
But now I am under, oh
And it's breaking over me,
A thousand miles down to the sea bed,
I found the place to rest my head.
Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me, (so cold and so sweet)
And all this devotion was rushing out of me,
And the crashes are heaven, for a sinner like me,
But the arms of the ocean deliver me.
And it's over,
And I'm going under,
But i'm not giving up!
I'm just giving in.
AWooooooooooooooah!
Slipping underneath.
AWooooooooooooooah!
So cold and so sweet.
In the arms of the ocean, so sweet and so cold,
And all this devotion, I never knew at all,
And the crashes are heaven, for a sinner released,
But the arms of the ocean deliver me.
Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.
Deliver me.
Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.
Deliver me.
Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.
Never let me go, never let me go.
And it's over,
And I'm going under,
But i'm not giving up!
I'm just giving in.
AWooooooooooooooah,
Slipping underneath.
AWooooooooooooooah,
So cold and so sweet."
No Light No Light	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/no_light_no_light-lyrics-1370537.html	-	"You are the hole in my head
You are the space in my bed
You are the silence in between
What I thought and what I said
You are the night-time fear
You are the morning when it's clear
When it's over your start
You're my head
You're my heart
No light, no light in your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
No light
Tell me what you want me to say
Through the crowded islands
Crying out at me
In your place there were a thousand other faces
I will disappear in plain sight
Heaven help me
I need to make it right
You want a revelation
You want to get right
But it's a conversation
I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation
Some kind of resolution
You are the revelation
No light, no light in your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
No light
Tell me what you want me to say
But would you leave me,
If I told you what I've done
And would you leave me
If I told you what I've become
'Cause it's so easy,
To sing it to a crowd
But it's so hard, my love
To say it to you, all alone
No light, no light in your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day,
You can choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light
No light
Tell me what you want me to say
You want a revelation
You want to get right
But, it's a conversation
I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation
Some kind of resolution.
You are the revelation.
You want a revelation
You want to get right.
But, it's a conversation,
I just can't have tonight.
You want a revelation
Some kind of resolution
Tell me what you want me to say"
Only If For A Night	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/only_if_for_a_night-lyrics-1370543.html	-	"[Florence]
And I had a dream
About my old school
And she was there all pink and gold
And glittery
I threw my arms around her legs,
(Came to weeping, came to weeping)
Then I heard your voice as clear as day,
And you told me I should concentrate,
It was all so strange,
And so surreal,
That a ghost should be so practical.
Only if for a night
And the only solution was to stand and fight,
And my body was losing all the satellites,
But you came over me like some holy life,
And I know the whole story,
You're the only light
Only if for a night
The grass was so green against my new clothes,
And I did cartwheels in your honour.
Dancing on tiptoes,
My own secret ceremonials,
Before the service began.
In the graveyard, doing handstands.
And I heard your voice as clear as day,
And you told me I should concentrate ,
It was all so strange,
And so surreal,
That a ghost should be so practical.
Only if for a night.
And the only solution was to stand and fight,
And my body was loosing all the sattelites,
But you came over me like some holy life,
And I know the whole story,
You're the only light.
Only if for a night.
Ooohh,
Oooooohhhh,
Woah-woah-woah.
My doh, my dear, my darling,
Tell me what all this sighing's about,
Tell me what all this sighing's about.
And I heard your voice as clear as day,
And you told me I should concentrate,
It was all so strange,
And so surreal,
That a ghost should be so practical.
Only if for a night.
Yeyeyeye-yeyeyeye-ahhaaaooooh."
Rabbit Heart (Raise It Up)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/rabbit_heart_raise_it_up-lyrics-1315266.html	Album: Lungs	"The looking glass so shiny and new
How quickly the glamor fades
I start spinning slipping out of time
Was that the wrong pill to take (Raise it up)
You made a deal and now it seems you have to offer up
But will it ever be enough
(Raise it up raise it up)
It's not enough
(Raise it up raise it up)
Here I am a rabbit hearted girl
Frozen in the headlights
It seems Ive made the final sacrifice
We raise it up this offering
We raise it up
This is a gift it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight
I look around but I can't find you
(Raise it up)
If only I could see your face
(Raise it up)
Instead of rushing towards the skyline
(Raise it up)
I wish that I could just be brave
I must become a lion hearted girl
Ready for a fight
Before I make the final sacrifice
We raise it up this offering
We raise it up
This is a gift it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight
Raise it up raise it up
(Repeat)
And in the spring I shed my skin
And it blows away with the changing wind
The waters turn from blue to red
As towards the sky I offer it
This is a gift it comes with a price
Who is the lamb and who is the knife
Midas is king and he holds me so tight
And turns me to gold in the sunlight
(Repeat)"
Seven Devils	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/seven_devils-lyrics-1370538.html	-	"[Florence]
Holy water cannot help you now
A thousand armies couldn't keep me out
I don't want your money
I don't want your crowd
See I have to tell you
I've come to burn your kingdom down
Holy water cannot help you now
See I've had to burn your kingdom down
And no rivers and no lakes can put the fire out
I'm gonna raise the stakes, I'm gonna smoke you out
Seven devils all around you!
Seven devils in my house!
See they were there when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See I was dead when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done
And now all your love will be exercised
And we will find you saints to be cannonized
And it's an even sum
It's a melody
It's a final cry
It's a symphony
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in my house
See they were there when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See I was dead when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done
Before the day is done
Before the day is done
They can keep me high
'Til I tear the walls
'Til I save your heart
And to take your soul
What have we done?
Can it be undone?
In the evil's heart
In the evil's soul
Seven devils all around you
Seven devils in your house
See I was dead when I woke up this morning
I'll be dead before the day is done
Before the day is done"
Shake It Out	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/shake_it_out-lyrics-1370532.html	-	"Regrets collect like old friends
Here to relive your darkest moments
I can see no way, I can see no way
And all of the ghouls come out to play
And every demon wants his pound of flesh
But I like to keep some things to myself
I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn
And I've been a fool and I've been blind
I can never leave the past behind
I can see no way, I can see no way
I'm always dragging that horse around
And our love is pastured such a mournful sound
Tonight I'm gonna bury that horse in the ground
So I like to keep my issues drawn
But it's always darkest before the dawn
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaaah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh woah
I am done with my graceless heart
So tonight I'm gonna cut it out and then restart
Cause I like to keep my issues drawn
It's always darkest before the dawn
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh woah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back so shake him off
And given half the chance would I take any of it back
It's a fine romance but its left me so undone
It's always darkest before the dawn
Oh woah, oh woah...
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my road
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark and right at my throat
Cause looking for heaven, found the devil in me
Looking for heaven, found the devil in me
Well why the hell I'm gonna let it happen to me
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh woah
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
Shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, shake it out, ooh woaaah
And it's hard to dance with a devil on your back
So shake him off, oh woah"
Spectrum	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/spectrum-lyrics-1370540.html	-	"[Florence]
When we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colors on our skin
We were light and paper-thin
And when we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colors on our skin
Til you let the spectrum in
Say my name,
And every color illuminates,
We are shining,
And we'll never be afraid again.
Say my name!
As every color illuminates!
We are shining!
And we'll never be afraid again!
Say my name!
As every color illuminates!
We are shining!
And we'll never be afraid again!
And when we come for you,
We'll be dressed up all in blue,
With the ocean in our arms,
Kissing eyes and kissing palms.
And when it's time to pray,
We'll be dressed up all in grey,
With metal on our tongues,
And silver in our lungs.
Say my name,
And every color illuminates,
We are shining,
And we'll never be afraid again.
Say my name!
As every color illuminates!
We are shining!
And we'll never be afraid again!
Say my name!
As every colour illuminates!
We are shining!
And we'll never be afraid again!
And when we come back we'll be dressed in black!
And you'll scream our names aloud!
And we won't eat and we won't sleep!
We'll drag bodies from their graves!
So say my name,
And every color illuminates,
And we are shining,
And we'll never be afraid again,
Say my name,
As every color illuminates.
Say my name!
As every color illuminates!
We are shining!
And we'll never be afraid again!
Say my name!
As every color illuminates!
We are shining!
And we'll never be afraid again!
Say my name!
We are shining!
Say my name!
Say my name!
And we'll never be afraid again!"
What The Water Gave Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/what_the_water_gave_me-lyrics-1370533.html	-	"[Florence Welch]
Time it took us
To where the water was
That's what the water gave me
And time goes quicker
Between the two of us
Oh, my love, don't forsake me
Take what the water gave me
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
And oh poor Atlas
The world's a beast of a burden
You've been holding on a long time
And all this longing
And the ships are left to rust
That's what the water gave us
So lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
'Cause they took your loved ones
But returned them in exchange for you
But would you have it any other way?
Would you have it any other way?
You could have had it any other way'
Cause she's a cruel mistress
And the bargain must be made
But oh, my love, don't forget me
Though I let the water take me
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the over flow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow
Pockets full of stones
Lay me down
Let the only sound
Be the overflow"
You've Got The Love	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/florence_the_machine/youve_got_the_love-lyrics-1315261.html	Album: Lungs	"Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying ""Lord I just don't care""
But you've got the love I need To see me through
Sometimes it seems that the going is just too rough
And things go wrong no matter what I do
Now and then it seems that life is just too much
But you've got the love I need to see me through
When food is gone you are my daily meal
When friends are gone I know my savior's love is real
Your love is real
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
Time after time I think ""Oh Lord what's the use?""
Time after time I think it's just no good
Sooner or later in life, the things you love you loose
But you got the love I need to see me through
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
Sometimes I feel like throwing my hands up in the air
I know I can count on you
Sometimes I feel like saying ""Lord I just don't care""
But you've got the love I need to see me through
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love
You got the love"
