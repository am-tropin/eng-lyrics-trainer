A Light In The Black	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/a_light_in_the_black-lyrics-246430.html	Rising	"Can't forget his face
What a lonely place
Has he really let us go?
All the time that's lost
What's the final cost
Will I really get away?
All my life it seems
Just a crazy dream
Reaching for somebody's star
Can't believe it all
Did he really fall
What to do now I don't know
Something's called me back
There's a light in the black
Am I ready to go?
I'm coming home
Breathed the air before
Heard the thunder roar
Never knew it was for me
Always looking down
Lost and never found
Eyes that look but not to see
All my life it seems
Just a crazy dream
Reaching for somebody's star
Like an open door
That you've passed before
But you've never had the key
Something's calling me back
There's a light in the black
Am I ready to go?
I'm coming home, I'm coming home, yeah
I'm going back to my home
I'm going home, home, home
Going home, home, home
I'm coming back
Don't forget his face
What a lonely place
Did he really let us go
All the time that's lost
What's the final cost
Will I really get away?
All my life it seems
Just a crazy dream
Reaching for somebody's star
Can't believe it all
Did he really fall
What to do now, well I don't know
Something's calling me back
Like a light in the black
Yes, I'm ready to go
I'm coming home, home, yeah
I've got my way back home
To the sky
There in the sky
I see your star"
All Night Long	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/all_night_long-lyrics-469124.html	Down To Earth	"You're walking up with your eyes on me
It's looking good but I just don't know
I need a girl who can keep her head
All night long
You didn't came just to see the show
I guess you know what you wanna see
The way you smile lets me know
I can't go wrong
I wanna touch you
I wanna feel you
I wanna make you mine
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I saw you standing down by the stage
Your black stockings and you see - through dress
Your mouth is open but I don't wanna hear you
Say goodnight
You're sort of young but you're over age
I don't care 'cause I like your style
I don't know about your brain but
You look all right
I wanna touch you
I wanna feel you
I wanna make you mine
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
Your mind is dirty but your hands are clean
You show no class but your legs are long
I know I can't stand another night
On my own
Hey girl would you like some wine
What's your name are you by yourself
Are you the one what do you say
Can I take you home
I wanna touch you
I wanna feel you
I wanna make you mine
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long
I wanna love you all night long
I wanna be with you all night long"
Ariel	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/ariel-lyrics-246393.html	Stranger in Us All	"I search for her in the dead of night
A silhouette lit by candle light
In a whispered word she is gone
Familiar stranger without a name
In a darkened room they all look the same
Like the sand of time she slips away so far away
In the mirror you can see her face
An angel dressed in the blackest lace
A sip of wine and the game can begin
Just an image lost in fantasy
Then you touch her and you can't break free
Till you see your fate written there in her eyes
Oh Ariel,
Lost in a distant dream, take me home
Ariel"

BEETHOVEN'S NINTH SYMPHONY
Friedrich von Schiller's Ode to Joy in Beethoven's setting for
four soloists, chorus
and orchestra has taken on a special meaning as a fanfare for
peace, tolerance and
liberty all over the world.
Beethoven's drafts for his opus 125 - the last in the cycle of
symphonies - date back
to the year 1815 or 1816. For decades he had been wanting to
set Schiller's hymn to
music, but it was only after the first three movements of the
9th Symphony were
almost completed that he decided to compose a choral finale
for the last movement
based on parts of the poem.
In the conventions of the 1820s it was nothing less than
revolutionary to end a
symphony in this manner - and at just over an hour the work
was also unusually
long. At its first performance, in Vienna on May 7, 1824, the
audience was typically
enthusiastic, while the critics, as so often before, found the
composer's unique
ideas too novel and daring.
Beethoven himself could not hear the clamour and the shouts of
'Bravo', as he was
completely deaf by this time.
AN DIE FREUDE - ODE TO JOY
O Freunde, nicht diese T'e!
Sondern lasst uns angenehmere anstimmen
und freudenvollere!
Freude, sch'er G'terfunken,
Tochter aus Elysium,
Wir betreten feuertrunken.
Himmlische, dein Heiligtum!
Deine Zauber binden wieder
Was die Mode streng geteilt;
Alle Menschen werden Br'er
Wo dein sanfter Fl'el weilt.
Wem der grosse Wurf gelungen
Eines Freundes Freund zu sein,
Wer ein holdes Weib errungen,
Mische seinen Jubel ein!
Ja, wer auch nur eine Seele
Sein nennt auf dem Erdenrund!
Und wer's nie gekonnt, der stehle
Weinend sich aus diesem Bund.
Freude trinken alle Wesen
An den Br'ten der Natur;
Alle Guten, alle B'en,
Folgen ihrer Rosenspur.
K'se gab sie uns und Reben,
Einen Freund, gepr't im Tod;
Wollust ward dem Wurm gegeben,
Und der Cherub steht vor Gott!
Froh, wie seine Sonnen fliegen
Durch des Himmels pr'ht'gen Plan,
Laufet, Br'er, eure Bahn,
Freudig, wie ein Held zum Siegen.
Seid umschlungen, Millionen.
Dieser Kuss der ganzen Welt!
Br'er! ?er'm Sternenzelt
Muss ein lieber Vater wohnen.
Ihr st'zt nieder, Millionen?
Ahnest du den Sch'fer, Welt?
Such ihn ?er'm Sternenzelt!
?er Sternen muss er wohnen.

solo)

Black Masquerade	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/black_masquerade-lyrics-246391.html	Stranger in Us All	"I know the key to secrets never told, they're hidden in your soul
Feelings you hide never wanting me to find they've always been mine
Release all the madness within let it all begin
Now you'll see, the dark side of me
In our black masquerade
Let the moonlight surround you
The game that we play is
The black masquerade
The full moon unmasks the stranger in us all
And the cruel world takes its toll
The shadow is cast on who you used to be
Let me set you free
Come now, come take my hand, then you'll understand
We'll go to that forbidden land
Of our black masquerade
Let the darkness surround you
The game that we play is the black masquerade
Release all the madness within, let it all begin
We'll go to that forbidden land
Come let me take you there
Let the moonlight surround you
Don't be afraid, it's the black masquerade"
Black Sheep Of The Family	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/black_sheep_of_the_family-lyrics-246441.html	Rainbow	"I've got nothing in my head
Got a floor for a bed
The future's at the bottom of a tea cup
I got a half a pair of shoes
And no time to lose
I'm wondering when I'm going to wise up
So, fortune shine your light on me and my clothes
Cause we need some security
You get a little bad luck
And it grows and it grows
I'm the black sheep of the family
I've got half a pound of rice
A beard full of lice
A mission called retrogression
I've got pocket full of dust
And eating is a must
You want to make a good impression
So, fortune shine your light on me and my dog
Cause we need some security
While all the folks are living high up the hill
I'm the black sheep of the family
Don't talk to me about society
You got to pay the rules
Or pay the penalty
Because there's nothing to choose
Between a handful of blues
Double indemnity
The hour was wrong
And my shadow's getting long
My real life's a song, don't need much
But I've got an ache in my head
I wanna go to bed
Tomorrow I don't have to wake up, no
So wisdom shine your light on me and my knees
Cause it's true what they say about familiarity
There's nothing good this way
And it's true they say
I'm the black sheep of the family
Oh, my wisdom shine your light on me and my knees
It's true what they say about familiarity
There's nothing good this way
And it's true they say
I'm the black sheep of the family
Yeah, yeah
I'm the black sheep of the family
Just me and my dog, yeah, yeah
I'm the black sheep of the family
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm the black sheep of the family
You've got me on my knees
I'm the black sheep of the family

Walking the line to the end
I was ready to fall, had my back to the wall
But I'm flying again...
I been shifting my gears, I been moving
Cause they wanted me dead or alive
But I'm making a break and I want you to take a ride
Take a ride --
Bring on the night
Into the shadows and out of the light
Bring on the night...
Let the Dream Chaser take you away
When the sun hits another horizon...
And the joker has started to deal...
You can quit if you choose but there's nothing to lose
By a spin of the wheel
Gotta burn all your bridges behind you, they'll keep dragging
You down if you stay...
And I know I ain't wrong cause I'm free and I'm on my way
Bring on the night
Into the shadows and out of the light
Bring on the night
Let the Dream Chaser take you away
I live on the edge of tomorrow
I'm racing along on the wind
I can see what I need, you better believe
I'm playin' to win
I got nothin' to fear when I'm flyin'
Cause yesterday over and gone
And there's nothin' I can do... so I gotta keep movin' on...
Movin' on --

Bring on the night
Into the shadows and out of the light...

Let the Dream Chaser take you away... take you away

Bye Bye Baby Goodbye	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/bye_bye_baby_goodbye-lyrics-469123.html	-	"Whooaaa
I get the same old dream, same time every night
Fall to the ground and I wake up
So I get out of bed, put on my shoes, and in my head
- Thoughts fly back to the break-up
These four walls are closing in
Look at the fix you've put me in!!
Chorus:
Since You've Been Gone, Since You've Been Gone
I'm outta my head, Can't take it
Could I be wrong, but Since You've Been Gone
You cast the spell, so break it
Oooohhh - Whhooooaaa - Ooooohhh
Since You've Been Gone
So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night-time comes around too soon
- You can't know what you mean to me
Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn
CHORUS
If you will come back
Baby you know
You'll never do wrong

Can't Happen Here	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/cant_happen_here-lyrics-246417.html	Difficult to Cure	"Contaminated fish and micro chips
Huge supertankers on Arabian trips
Oily propaganda from the leader's lips
All about the future
There's people over here, people over there
Everybody's looking for a little more air
Crossing all the borders just to take their share
Planning for the future
[Refrain:]
And we're so abused, and we're so confused
It's easy to believe that someone's gonna light the fuse
Can't happen here, can't happen here
All that you fear they're telling you, can't happen here
Supersonic planes for a holiday boom
Rio de Janeiro in an afternoon
People out of work but there's people on the moon
Looking for the future
Concrete racetracks nationwide
Juggernauts carving up the countryside
Cars by the million on a one way ride
Using up the future
[Refrain]
Satellites sprying for the CIA
The KGB and the man in grey
Wonder if I'm gonna see another day
Somewhere in the future
We got everything we need for a peaceful time
Take what you want but you can't take mine
Everybody's living on the Siegfried Line
Worried about the future
And we're so abused, and we're so confused
It's so easy to believe someone's gonna light it
Easy to believe someone's gonna light the fuse
Can't happen here, can't happen here
All that you fear they're telling you, can't

Night after night
I can't fight the emptiness inside
Nothing I can say
Now I know you're turning me away
You're wearing a disguise
You don't have to hide cause
The truth is in your eyes tonight
I don't want to live a lie
But I don't want to say goodbye
And I can't let you go even though it's over
I just can't let you go
Though your love is growing colder
One look in my eyes and you're realize
That you got my heart in your hands
Won't you let me know sometimes more
Where did we do wrong?
I don't want to fight
All I want to do is try to understand
I'm reaching out for you baby
What can I do
I've been holding on so long
I don't want to live a lie
But I don't want to say goodbye
I can't let you go
Even though it's over
I just can't let you go
I feel your love is growing colder
I don't want to live a lie
But I don't want to say goodbye
I want you by my side
And I can't let you go
Even though it's over

Catch The Rainbow	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/catch_the_rainbow-lyrics-246440.html	Rainbow	"When evening falls
She'll run to me
Like whispered dreams
Your eyes can't see
Soft and warm
She'll touch my face
A bed of straw
Against the lace
We believed we'd catch the rainbow
Ride the wind to the sun
Sail away on ships of wonder
But life's not a wheel
With chains made of steel
So bless me
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
We believed we'd catch the rainbow
Ride the wind to the sun
And sail away on ships of wonder
But life's not a wheel
With chains made of steel
So bless me, oh bless me, bless me
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
Come the dawn
Come the dawn"
Cold Hearted Woman	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/cold_hearted_woman-lyrics-246396.html	Stranger in Us All	"She came from across the water
A devil's daughter was in disguise
I crid for mercy - she bound and chained me
and then she played me, I was mesmerized
When she gave me blood red roses
They were wrapped in razor thorns
She was sly in her temptation
Then she left me on my own
Sutch a cold hearted woman
She promised passion everlasting
And now I'm haunted by her name
I gave up all that I ever cared for
Oh if I only had my yesterdays again
I've been blinded, now I'm broken
Sometimes I can hear her song
No man's grass was ever greener
Now I find that I don't belong
With a cold hearted woman
She touched my world and I was shaken
But she was fakin,?I never knew
These days are colder and there's no shoulder
I'm just the shell fo the man I was before
If there's somewhere I can run to
Till I kill the pain inside
I've been walking now for hours
Can't forget her, the Lord knows I've tried
Cause she's a cold, cold hearted woman"
Danger Zone	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/danger_zone-lyrics-519252.html	Down To Earth	"Shaking off the tresholds of a long forgotten dream
And you just can't make it last
Coaching paradise on a personal line
But you get fired to fast
And you lie, memories drifting by
Love don't make it on those pin-striped nights
When you're looking through someone's disguise
You can't make it alone, so you gotta make a move
But you're looking at nobody's eyes
Well that's love, or maybe love come and go
Looking for love is a danger zone
Love don't go begging in the danger zone
You won't get nothing from the danger zone
Tales that you tell from the stories that you'll hear
And you'll get what you can while you may
Don't understand when you're looking for a dame
But it's only a heartbreak away
And you'll learn, faking has no return
No way when you're feeling that way
Will your feet get caught up in the crowd
And the song that you sing is too soft to be heard
But your speakers are way too loud
Like the pain, loving is no big game
Looking for love is a danger zone
No don't go living in the danger zone
You won't get nothing from the danger zone
Don't take no chances in the danger zone
Love don't go begging in the danger zone
No don't go living in the danger zone
You won't get nothing from the danger zone
Don't take no chances in the danger zone
Love don't go begging in the danger zone"

Face in the mirror we meet eye to eye
Passions of eternal fire
Desperately wanting and out of control
Dancing on winds of desire
Oh - even the deadly shades of night
Won't let me hide... from her eyes of fire
Curtain of darkness, screams of delight
Tounts me with her sirens calling...
I got to be strong but I can't hang on
Into the flames I am falling...
Oh - even the deadly shades of night
Won't let me hide (no, no, no, no)

Without seeing at all
You ain't got a lot to say
Judging by the things you do
If only you could feel the tears and pain
In the eyes of the world
Dust to dust by the million
Broken dreams in the ground
Aching heart in the heartbeat of home
Where their spirits are gone
Evil takes, evil kills
With no shame or concern
Killing me, killing you
Watch the end of the burn
Maybe you didn't understand
We don't need you anymore
If only you could see the tears and pain
In the eyes of the world
And in the name of religion
For me gave him our soul
The clock with chime
Every second in my heart
For it's taken it's toll
Evil moves, evil ways
With his back to the wall
Evil man look at him down

Don't wanna, don't wanna cry no more

Say can't believe it's real
So you're gonna play the game
All the faces and the names
And you know you're never gonna change
Fool for the night
And you don't believe it
Fool for the night
And you just can't see it
Running through the shadows
Like a phantom in the night
And as the curtain raises
You get ready for the fight
Say you want to even up the score
Don't know what you're doing it for
Too much but you still need more
Fool for the night
And you don't believe it
Fool for the night
And you just can't see it
I ain't gonna try and tell ya
You know the story oh so well
Everybody's out to buy and sell ya
You're gonna wind up by yourself
Oh here it comes again
No it's never gonna end
I must be dreaming
Fool for the night [2 times]
Oh here it comes again
I ain't gonna try and tell ya
You know the story oh so well
Everybody's out to buy and sell ya
You're gonna wind up by yourself
Oh here it comes again
And I know it's never gonna end
I must be dreaming
You love the night life
All the neon and the noise
And underneath the spotlight
You keep rocking with the boys
So you're gonna get it while you can
But you're never gonna understand
Nobody really gives a damn
Fool for the night and you don't believe it
Fool for the night why don't you see it"
Freedom Fighter	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/freedom_fighter-lyrics-246416.html	Difficult to Cure	"You can't control me tell me what to do
Chained in mediocrity so I can be like you
I'm not a statue not part of a machine
I'm sick and tired of the whole routine
Calculate your future, computerize your past
Instant replay if it's gone too fast
Take away my freedom, take away my home
I'm only human but it might no show
I'm not made of stone
I'm a freedom fighter I got something to say
I'm a freedom fighter get out of my way
Hide behind your politics, hide behind your rules
Tell me I'm a man but you treat me like a fool
It's the same old story with a different name
You give us all a number and nothing changes
Out in the winter of a world upon it's knees
Everyone is watching but no-one sees
You can't take my freedom you know it is my right
If you try and stop me I'm gonna fight
With all of my might
I'm a freedom fighter and I'm taking command
I'm a freedom fighter and I'm making a stand
Fighting for breath as the world gathers speed
Time's running out for the things that I need
I'm a freedom fighter I gotta make a stand
I'm a freedom fighter, yeah That's what I am
I'm a freedom fighter I can't take it no more
I'm a freedom fighter no no more
I'm a freedom fighter but I'm not afraid
I'm a freedom fighter get out of my way"
Gates Of Babylon	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/gates_of_babylon-lyrics-246426.html	Long Live Rock'n'Roll	"Look away from the sea
I can take you anywhere
Spend a vision with me
A chase with the wind
Move closer to me
I can make you anyone
I think you're ready to see
The gates of Babylon
The power of what has been before
Rises to trap you within
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more
A city of heavenly sin
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away
Oh gates of Babylon
You can see but you're blind
Someone turned the sun around
But you can see in your mind
The gates of Babylon
You're riding the endless caravan
Bonded and sold as a slave
A sabre dance removing all the veils
Getting as good as you gave
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away
Look away from the sea
I can take you anywhere
Spend a vision with me
A chase with the wind
Move closer to me
I can make you anyone
I think you're ready to see
The gates of Babylon
The power of what has been before
Rises to trap you within
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more
A city of heavenly sin
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay
Sleep with the devil and the devil will take you away
Black gates of Babylon
The devil is me
And I'm holding the key
To the gates of sweet hell
Babylon"
Hall Of The Mountain King	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/hall_of_the_mountain_king-lyrics-519249.html	Stranger in Us All	"Mysteries of ages told, stories now will unfold
Tales of mystic days of old are hidden in these walls
Hear the witches play their tunes, sing their songs to the moon
As they play the night will move, in the hall of the mountain king
Wild child so innocent
You took that away
Thoughts of wonder and surprise hide themselves in your eyes
As the smoke begins to rise inside the mountain halls
Ancient tales of witches love, answers lie through that door
All you'd ever want and more, is calling for you now
Through darkend corridors
Try but you cannot break free
You took her innocence
Now you will answer to me
I am the mountain king
Are you not afraid? I am the mountain king
Listen to the bells
In a midnight fantasy, more than any eye can see
Hear them laughing crazily, It's out of control
Mysteries of ages told, stories now will unfold
Tales of mystic days of old are hidden in these walls
Through darkend corridors
Run but you cannot escape
You took her innocence
And for this crime you must pay
I am the mountain king, are you not afraid?
I am the mountain king"
Hunting Humans (Insatiable)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/hunting_humans_insatiable-lyrics-246395.html	Stranger in Us All	"Justify, speak the lies, close your eyes
As we make love
Touch my skin, let the fun begin, once again
I hear your cries, rise oh rise
Feel the nails, tell tales trails across my spine
Beautiful
Silken kiss, on a night like this, who would miss
Our final hour
Closer still, close your eyes, see my world, it's animal
Insatiable
Velvet glove, unrequited love, find the words
And make them rhyme
One last dance, hypnotizing trance, a knowing glance
I love you
Closer still, lose your will, see my world, it's criminal
Insatiable
Things we hide, keep them out of signt, heard it said
It's unbearable
Feel my pain, taste my shame, who's to blame
Inexcusable"
I Surrender	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/i_surrender-lyrics-246421.html	Difficult to Cure	"I surrender to your heart babe
Do anything that you want me to do
Please be tender I'm in your hands girl
This is a feeling I never knew
You know I tried to make it on my own
That's not the way it was meant to be
Spend my time waiting by the phone
Oh darling come back to me
I surrender, I surrender
I'm giving up the role of pretender
Oh be tender, girl be tender
Can't you feel the love that I send you
I surrender.
I remember, seems like a lifetime
Can't believe it's a matter of days
Since you left me I'm near to heartbreak
I want you so bad don't turn away
What does it take to stay by my side
You know I'll do what you want me to
Don't take away this feeling inside
I'm still in love with you
I surrender, I surrender
I'm giving up the role of pretender
I remember, I remember
Can't you feel the love that I send you
I surrender.
I surrender, I surrender
Darling now won't you be tender
Surrender, oh surrender
Feel the love that I send you
I surrender."
If You Don't Like Rock & Roll	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/if_you_dont_like_rock_roll-lyrics-246437.html	Rainbow	"You'd never know there was music playing,
Until you talked your way inside the door.
And then a sound like rolling thunder
Began to push you right through the floor.
And there's a great white sign with big black letters
That just about explains it all:
""If you don't like rock and roll,
If you don't like rock and roll,
If you don't like rock and roll,
Then it's too late now.""
Anastasia was a huge lady.
And she was dressed the way the stories tell.
So, being cool, I made a move to grab her.
But you could see she'd read the story well.
And then she whipped out a card with big black letters
That just about explained it all:
""If you don't like rock and roll,
If you don't like rock and roll,
If you don't like rock and roll,
Then you're too late now."""
Jealous Lover	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/jealous_lover-lyrics-469122.html	Very Best of Rainbow	"Lost and lonely
Clouds hide the sun

Cold empty nights
Demons in my head
It's something I did
Or baby something you said
And it's hard to discover
That you're just another
Jealous Lover
And its so tough to take
But you're making no mistake
Jealous Lover

Ask me no questions
I'll tell you no lies
Still you keep thinking
That it's all alibis
And it's hard to discover
You're like any other
Jealous Lover
And you're saying I'm a fake
But you're making a mistake
Oh, no no
Every day it's the same
The faces and the names
How long can I go on
Playing this game
So I live for the nights
Soft candle lights
Today they love you
Then tomorrow they might
And it's hard to face
Someone else takes your place
Jealous Lover
And they're saying that's the brakes
But I got what it takes
Jealous Lover, ohh oh
Jealous Lover

Don't need no, no no
Don't need no other

Lady Of The Lake	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/lady_of_the_lake-lyrics-246428.html	Long Live Rock'n'Roll	"There's a magical sound slidin' over the ground
Makin' it shiver and shake
And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky
Slippery and sly like a snake
With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth
A shadow has covered the light
Then a beam in the shade from a silvery blade
Has shattered the edge of the night
I know she waits below
Only to rise on command
When she comes for me
She's got my life in her hands
When a movement behind hit the side of my mind
I trembled and shook it away
Then another assault and I started to faulter
Fibres of steel turned to clay
With a bubbly turn now the water should churn
And push it way from the core
And a lady in white will bring sun to the night
Brighter than ever before
I know she waits below
Only to rise on command
When she comes for me
She's got my life in her hands
Lady of the lake
There's a magical sound slidin' over the ground
Makin' it shiver and shake
And a permanent cry fallin' out of the sky
Slippery and sly like a snake
With a delicate move kind of shifty and smooth
A shadow has covered the light
Then a beam in the shade from a slivery blade
Has shattered the edge of the night
Straight down I'm swirling around
Blinded and bruised by the strain
There must be some way to see
Diamonds out of the rain
I know she waits below
Only to rise on command
When she comes for me
She's got my life in her hands
Lady of the lake"

Rock N' Roll!!!!
At the end of a dream
If you know where I mean
When the mist just starts to clear
In a similar way
At the end of today
I could feel the sound of writing on the wall
It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screaming in my mind
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock n roll
Long live rock and roll
Let it liiive
In a different time
When the words didn't rhyme
You could never quite be sure
Then on with the change
It was simple but strange
And you knew the feeling seemed to say it all
It cries for you
It's the least that you can do
Like a spiral on the wind
I can hear it screaming in my mind
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock n roll
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock and roll
Long live rock n roll
Long live rock and roll"
Lost In Hollywood	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/lost_in_hollywood-lyrics-519248.html	Down To Earth	"Gotta get a message through
Cause I think I'm losing you
Am I too late
Drinking habit's a loose sometime
I gotta know if you're still mine
And I can't wait
Last time I saw your face
You tried to hide the tears
But I could see the trace
I'd be there if I could
But it's so far away from home
Lost in Hollywood
In the dark the vultures wait
I can hear them
Knocking at my gate
But I'm not here
The brew was cold
The meat is stale
In the L.A. night the sirens wail
The song you can feel
Pale stars that never shine
Scotch and the whiskey
And the Rainbow local wine
She's done more bad than good
I gotta get away somehow
Lost in Hollywood
On the streets the sun is fine
Don't you feel the advantage hit your mind
Feels all right oh yeah
But I'm a lover
Like a loaded gun
Chasing shadows on the run
Out in the night
I'm gonna lose control
If I been losing you
To pay for rock'n'roll
Get back I know I should
Gotta get back home to you
You don't know what I been through
But there's nothing I can do
Lost in Hollywood"

When love's no friend of mine

Just don't seem to feel no pain
Natural loser I've been on the run
Got no shelter from the rain

Ain't gonna fall for the line

Don't need no sun to shine
No cause love's no friend of mine
Learn to live wether climb above my head
Got no shame, got no pride
If you need affection
Don't knock on my door
Got no feelings left inside
But that's allright
That's allright
Ain't gonna fall for the line
That's allright
That's allright
Don't need no sun to shine
Cause love's no friend
Cause love's no friend
Ah no friend of mine
Love's no friend of mine"

That hangs on the edge of illusion

Mystery of time hidden by a man of confusion
But the hand is quicker than the eye
Only the stranger knows why
'Cos it's magic
You know it's magic that you'll find
You see it's magic
I know who you are there's magic in you
Keep your eye on the man
And don't look away for a moment
How is it done how does he make me see
Something up his sleeve when he speaks you want
To believe him
But the hand is quicker than the eye
Only stranger knows why
'Cos it's magic
Can't you see it's magic that you'll find
You know it's magic
I know who you are 'cos there's magic in you
Driven by a force
Moving in another dimension
Here for today, gone for eternity
Seeking for truth
hidden by the word of his wisdom
But the hand is quicker than the eye
Only the stranger knows why
Can't you feel it's magic
You know it's magic that you'll find
I said it's magic
I know who you are 'cos there's magic in you"

Smiling back at me
It makes me feel so good
Need to keep you satisfied
The only way I know
And all the cares I cannot hide
Will never show
When we're makin' love
Woh makin' love
Don't believe that I'm a liar
But I can't get enough
Never knew I could be higher
Just by makin' love
How can I deny my heart
When my love is blind
I got no choice
I've gone too far

Frozen heart, eyes of steel
Wrap your body around my soul
Electric love is gonna take its' toll.
Can't see nowhere
Don't know and I don't care
That girl is the mother of my midtown tunnel vision.
Sunset skyline night turns to day
Down on the street you could fade away
No second chances in this here wasted life
It'll cut you down like a switchblade knife.

They're gonna wheel ya, deal ya, tell ya all the lies... (realize)
But I'm a hot shot, shoot em down let em be (that's me)
Cause I got nothin' for nothin' and nothin's ever free... no
Oh - so strong
All I gotta do is turn it on
Yeah - I'm gonna get my fill
Nothin's gonna stop me now and nothin' ever will
I got the power
Oh, I got the power
I can feel the power
I got the power
Yeah yeah yeah... turn it on
I can take anything that gets in my way
I don't worry 'bout tomorrow I just live for today...
Oh - so strong
Got the feeling when I turn it on
Yeah - I'm gonna get my fill
Nothin's gonna stop me now and nothin' ever will
I got the power
I can feel the power power
I can feel the power...
Turn it on...
Power (can you feel it)
Power
(You can turn it on, turn it on, switch it on behind)
(Super charged... I can feel the power)"
Rainbow Eyes	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/rainbow_eyes-lyrics-246422.html	Long Live Rock'n'Roll	"She's been gone since yesterday
Oh I didn't care
Never cared for yesterdays
Fancies in the air
No sighs or mysteries
She lay golden in the sun
No broken harmonies
But I've lost my way
She had rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes
Love should be a simple blend
A whispering on the shore
No clever words you can't defend
They lead to never more
No sighs or mysteries
She lay golden in the sun
No broken harmonies
But I've lost my way
She had rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes
Rainbow eyes
Summer nights are colder now
They've taken down the fair
All the lights have died somehow
Or were they ever there
No sighs or mysteries
She lay golden in the sun
No broken harmonies
But I've lost my way
She had rainbow eyes
Oooh, ooh"

Standin' in her ruby red shoes
Tellin' me she loves me only
Ever if it ain't true...
Ooh you... drippin' with desire
Skintight, dynamite
Fever takes me higher

Lemme see ya rock
Lemme see ya roll
Lemme see ya burn
Rock fever...
[Chorus:]
Yeah, gonna give it to you tonight (rock fever)
I can feel your blood run hot
Burnin' with a fire
Gimme everything you got
Right down to the wire
Ooh - temperature is risin'
Ain't no use I'm breakin' loose
I ain't gonna fight it
[Chorus:]
Come on, let me give you a shot...
44 calibre rock and roll
Fever deep inside her
Hits me straight between the eyes
When she open's fire...
Ooh... you
Drippin' with desire
Skin tight, you're dynamite
I can't get much higher

Run With The Wolf	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/run_with_the_wolf-lyrics-246433.html	Rising	"In the light of the day
You can hear the old ones say
Was the sound last night the wind?
Can you feel the change begin?
By the fall of the snow
A single soul will go
The footsteps on the white
There's an unholy light
There's a hole in the sky
Something evil's passing by
What's to come - when the siren calls you go
To run with the wolf
When the world makes a turn
The eyes of one will learn
That a sound just like the wind
Only makes the change begin
By the end of the rain
The feelings passed again
From things that snap and bite
An unholy light
There's a hole in the sky
Something evil's passing by
What's to come - when the siren calls you go
To run with the wolf
There's a break in the ground
Like the swirling water's angry as they pull you down
When the siren calls you go, yeah
To run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
There's a hole in the sky
Something evil is passing by
What's to come - when the siren calls you go, yeah
To run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
Like a beast in a field
He knows his fate is sealed
He runs with the wolf, oh oooh
Run with the wolf
See the break, you know it's the same(?)
Now he goes
To run, run, run
Run, run, run, run
Run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
Run with the wolf
Run, run, run
Now we go run, run, run, run
Run with the wolf
All right
Run with the wolf
Run with the wolf"
Self Portrait	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/self_portrait-lyrics-246442.html	Rainbow	"Paint me your picture and hang it on the wall
Color it darkly, the lines must start to crawl
Down, down, down
Spin me around and around
Draw me away to the night from the day
Leave not a trace to be found
Down, down
Nothing is real but the way that I feel
And I feel like going down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down, down
Paint me a picture of eyes that never see
With flashes of lightning that burn for only me
Hey hey hey
There's only the devil to pay
I'm ready to go
Pull me down from below
Give me a place I can lay
Hey hey
Nothing is real but the way that I feel
I feel like going down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Hey hey
Nothing is real but the way that I feel
And I feel like going down
Down, down
Nothing is real but the way that I feel
And I feel like going down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
Down, down, down, down

Should've touched some wood
Here she comes again
Reachin' out to bend my ear
She's worth another look
All the time it took
Pleasin' to the eye
How can I just disappear, oh
It ain't clear, no
She's a bright and shining star
But I just must be sensitive to light
Oh I just might, yeah
I could have let her in
Give her just a spin
Let her think it's love
Better rise above it all
She's knockin' at the door
Seems to want some more
Never gets the clue
What am I to do she'll fall
And she might call, oh no
She's a bright and shining star
But I just must be sensitive to light
Oh, I just know
She could do me well
I can always tell
She's ready for the kill
But I think that I will go, no
Sure I'm gonna see
Something just for me
Till it comes along
When it's feelin' wrong I'll know
Gotta take it slow, yeah
She's a bright and shining star
But I just must be sensitive to light
Oh, I might, yeah
She's a bright and blazing star
But I just must be sensitive to light, yeah
Sensitive to light, Ooooh"

Tearin' inside of you

Silence	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/silence-lyrics-246390.html	Stranger in Us All	"You say you want your freedom
It all gets a bit out of hand
Caught in the ocean as I'm watching you breathe
We all believe what we wanted to belive
That's the silence of love
You say all you want is money
You scream for a little bit more
Caught in a landslide as we're stumbling on
Who'd say we're right but who would say we're wrong
Silence of love
You say you need someone to hold you
You say that you're feeling afraid
I know the worst part of being alone
Is a book full of nombers with no one to phone
That's the silence of love"

Thoughts fly back to the breakup
These four wall are closing in
Look at the fix you put me in
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
I'm out of my head can't take it
Could I be wrong
But since you been gone
You cast your spell so break it
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Since you been gone
So in the night I stand beneath the backstreet light
I read the words that you sent to me
I can take the afternoon, the night time comes around
too soon
You can't know what you mean to me
Your poison letter, your telegram
Just goes to show you don't give a damn
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
I'm out of my head can't take it
Could I be wrong
But since you been gone
You cast your spell so break it
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Since you been gone
If you will come back
Baby, you know you'll never do wrong
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
I'm out of my head can't take it
Could I be wrong
But since you been gone
You cast your spell so break it
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Ever since you been gone
Since you been gone
Since you been gone
I'm out of my head can't take it
Since you been gone

Since he locked her in the tower
The time has come
He must be undone
By the morning
Many times before
The tyrant's opened up the door
Then someone cries
Still we close our eyes
Not again
Meet me when the sun is in the western skies
The fighting must begin before another someone dies
Cross bows in the fire light
Green sleeves waving
Madmen raving
Through the shattered night
Yeah yeah yeah
Flames are getting higher
Make it leap unto the spire
Draw bridge down
Cut it to the ground
We shall dance around the fire
No more night
We have seen the light
Let it shine on bright
Hang him higher, higher
Draw bridge down
Cut it to the ground
We shall dance all around the fire, around the fire
No more night
we've seen the light

Hang him higher, higher
Put the man on the fire
Draw bridge down
Cut it to the ground
We gotta dance around the fire, the fire, the fire"

Spotlight Kid	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/spotlight_kid-lyrics-246420.html	Difficult to Cure	"You don't know what's happening, you want to go home
But there's nowhere to hide
You walk out on stage, your first time alone
The crowd's going wild
And you feel so alive
You could stand up and take this all night
They love you but you're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid
Jokers and women they hang 'round your door
They're all part of the scene
Just like a junkie you've got to have more
It's a pleasure machine
And you fly every night
But the dressing room mirror don't lie
They love you but you're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid
Your audience died, faded away
It's been so many years since that first matinee
It seems like an age
Encore one more time
For the ghosts of the part in your mind
They love you but you're in love with the spotlight
You're the spotlight kid
You're living in a dream
You're the spotlight kid
You're in love with the spotlight"

What you trying to do
Money can't buy me out of trouble I'm in
I've been messing with the likes of you
Been so long since I left my home
Looks like I lost my way
Tried so hard just to make it work
You just turn around and walk away
Something's got to give, I ain't gonna leave
Time to dig down deep
If you wanna get out of this town alive
You gotta stand and fight
So infuriating the way you twist my words
I know you got your problems, it seems every day
That they're getting much worse
I hear you screaming for attention
You say your life's a mess
Something else to cry about
Just get on with it
Something's got to give, I ain't gonna leave
Time to dig down deep
If you wanna get out of this town alive
You gotta stand and fight"
Stargazer	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/stargazer-lyrics-246431.html	Rising	"High noon, oh I'd sell my soul for water
Nine years worth of breakin' my back
There's no sun in the shadow of the wizard
See how he glides, why he's lighter than air?
Oh I see his face!
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
I believe, yes, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
To see him fly
So many die
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
Just to see him fly
But don't know why
Now where do we go?
Hot wind, moving fast across the desert
We feel that our time has arrived
The world spins, while we put his dream together
A tower of stone to take him straight to the sky
Oh I see his face!
Where is your star?
Is it far, is it far, is it far?
When do we leave?
Hey, I believe, I believe
In the heat and the rain
With whips and chains
Just to see him fly
Too many die
We build a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But we don't know why
Ooh, now where do we go
All eyes see the figure of the wizard
As he climbs to the top of the world
No sound, as he falls instead of rising
Time standing still, then there's blood on the sand
Oh I see his face!
Where was your star?
Was it far, was it far
When did we leave?
We believed, we believed, we believed
In heat and rain
With the whips and chains
To see him fly
So many died
We built a tower of stone
With our flesh and bone
To see him fly
But why
In all the rain
With all the chains
Did so many die
Just to see him fly
Look at my flesh and bone
Now, look, look, look, look,
Look at his tower of stone
I see a rainbow rising
Look there, on the horizon
And I'm coming home, I'm coming home, I'm coming home
Time is standing still
He gave back my will
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
But it's not home
But it's not home
Ooh
Take me back
He gave me back my will
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Going home
I'm going home
My eyes are bleeding
And my heart is leaving here
But it's not home
But it's not home
Ooh
Take me back, take me back
Back to my home ooh, ooh, ooh"

Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night...
Stone Cold...

Can't break away from your spell
Another dark and empty night
It was wrong I wanna make it night
But you are so distant, so far away

breaking the silence without a sound
Oh familiar strangers, with nothing to say
Searching in the darkness
Fading out of sight
Love was here and gone like a thief in the night
Stone Cold...
And I thought I knew you so well...

A million miles out on my own

Magic and madness it's so very strange
Sometimes I think it's all pre-arranged
That same old feeling hits me again
Just the beginning but it feels like the end
Oh feel like I'm stranded out here
Oh I think I might disappear
No don't leave me stranded out here
Oh it's just the loneliness I fear
Lonely window fading star
You never felt so near yet so far
Tried to forget you the bet that I could
Don't try to find me it won't do any good
I'm caught in a dream so hard to locate
I'm just a captive of my own fate
No turning back no not tonight
You're moving on way out of sight
Oh I think I might disappear
No don't leave me stranded out here
Oh it's just the loneliness I fear

Pulled down I just kept on falling
I've seen this place before
You were standing by my side
I've seen your face before tonight
Maybe I just see what I want to be
I know it's a mystery
Do you remember me on a street of dreams,
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams
There you stood a distant memory
So good like we never parted
Said to myself I knew you'd set me free
And here we are right back where we started
Something's come over me
And I don't know what to feel
Maybe this fantasy is real
Now it's still a mystery
Do you remember me on a street of dreams,
Running through my memory
On the street of dreams
You are on every face I see
On the street of dreams
Tell me have you always been
On the street of dreams
Will we ever meet again my friend
Do you know just who you'll see do ya
On the street of dreams
You can be who you want to be oh yeh
I can hear you calling me
I can feel you haunting me
Haunting me"

The Temple Of The King	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/the_temple_of_the_king-lyrics-246438.html	Rainbow	"One day in the year of the fox
Came a time remembered well
When the strong young man of the rising sun
Heard the tolling of the great black bell
One day in the year of the fox
When the bell began to ring
Meant the time had cometh
For one to go
To the temple of the king
There in the middle of the circle he stands
Searching, seeking
With just one touch of his trembling hand
The answer will be found
Daylight waits while the old man sings
Heaven help me
And then like the rush of a thousand wings
It shines upon the one
And the day had just begun
One day in the year of the fox
Came a time remembered well
When the strong young man of the rising sun
Heard the tolling of the great black bell
One day in the year of the fox
When the bell began to sing
It meant the time had cometh
For one to go
To the temple of the king
There in the middle of the people
He stands
Seeing, feeling
With just a wave of a strong right hand
He's gone
To the temple of the king
Far from the circle at the edge of the world
He's hoping, wondering
Thinking back from the stories he's heard
Of what he's going to see
There in middle of the circle it lies
Heaven help me
Then all could see by the shine in his eyes
The answer had been found
Back with the people in the circle
He stands
Giving, feeling
With just one touch of a strong right hand
They know
Of the temple and the king"
Tite Squeeze	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/tite_squeeze-lyrics-246411.html	Straight between the Eyes	"I ain't lyin' to you baby... I hope you don't refuse
But I'm red hot... Ready or not... to give my love to you
I don't have forever, but I got tonight
The look in your eye said you'll give it a try...
I know the moment's right
Ooh -- give it to me... you got everything I need
Ooh -- do it to me... Bring me to my knees...
When you gimme that Tite Squeeze...
Baby, baby please...
Gimme that Tite Squeeze...
When you start to touch me... I can't believe it's real
You make it hard for me to take, I love the way you feel
I'm hungry for you baby, I just can't get enough...
If it's alright I'll take bite, I'll taste your love
Ooh - give it to me... you got everything I need
Ooh - do it to me... bring me to my knees...
When you gimme that Tite Squeeze -
Gimme the tite squeeze - yeah
Rock me in your cradle, roll me like the dice
Do it to me and I'll do it to you, do it till we do it right
Don't tell me that you love me, when you walk out the door
Cause I'll hold you down, turn you around, I'll come back for more
Ooh - give it to me... you got everything I need
Ooh - do it to me... bring me to my knees...
When you gimme that Tite, Tite, Tite yeah...
Gimme that Tite Squeeze, ooh baby, gimme that Tite squeeze
Oh - bring me to my knees, gimme that Tite squeeze"
Too Late For Tears	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/too_late_for_tears-lyrics-246392.html	Stranger in Us All	"Well I'm moving faster close to the edge
As I smoka a pack of strong cigarettes
When my fears run dry, you won't see me cry
Coz I know I got it coming
We touched the sun and went on our way
And we asked the stars to come out to play
But you said good night when they lost their light
And my world stopped spinning `round
What are we fighting for
Dontcha know that no one wins
What are we fighting for
Just give up and I'll give in
It's too late for tears
When the things you need are things you don't want
And you take the needle right to the point
I'd be heaven bound, but you shoot me down
Leave me broke and bleeding on the killing floor"
Wolf To The Moon	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/rainbow/wolf_to_the_moon-lyrics-246397.html	Stranger in Us All	"With a rebel mind and a gypsy heart
No place could ever be home
Drawn like a wolf to the moon it calls to my soul
Ain't got no woman, they just tie me down
Freedom is my only friend
I get a feeling destiny lies 'round the bend
One for the road
Slave to the highway
King of the road
Chasing the sun as it sets in the sky
Swear that I'll catch it someday
Lights of the city behind are fadingg away
Makin' my way through the names on the map
No point in feeling alone
As long as I ride the open road I'll always have a home
One for the road
Slave to the highway
King of the road
My future is calling a cry in the wind
Leading me out of my past
Got no destination but know that I'm getting there fast
Crossed many miles got so many to go
Each one calling my name
Won't settle down and you know I'll never be tamed
One for the road
Slave to the highway
King of the road"
