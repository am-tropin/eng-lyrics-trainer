(Do You Get) Excited?	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/do_you_get_excited-lyrics-14993.html	Joyride	"when the day gets dark
over a thousand streets
and you feel your heart
is a living beat.
when you're all alone
and you close your eyes,
naked to the bone
the dream comes alive.
do you get excited
when I touch you in the night?
my oh my...
do you get excited
when I meet you every night?
you won't let the night pass you by.
when your body's hot,
the window's open wide.
this moment's all you got
in this race of life.
when you feel the fire
is getting close to you,
hey baby, you know Iæ?¦ lonely too.
do you get excited
when I touch you in the night?
my oh my...
do you get excited
hen I meet you every night?
you won't let the night pass you by.
I wanna know..."
(I Could Never) Give You Up	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/i_could_never_give_you_up-lyrics-14981.html	Look Sharp!	"I've been hiding,
lost in the love of another.
I've followed the moon and a song
and I thought it would take me forever
to find a place where I belong.
I watch a rainbow rise.
I give you all I've got.
I could never give you up,
the way you make my love shine.
I could never give you up,
the way you make true love shine.
I believe you
when you say you don't want to be lonely.
I'll carry your heart like a bridge
when you need all the time you can find
to get the hurt out of your mind.
I'll watch the rain go by and give you all I've got.
Cause I could never give you up..."
7Twenty7	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/7twenty7-lyrics-15048.html	Have A Nice Day	"7twenty7 is ready to move
You know she packed her bags
With nothing left to prove
I thought I didn't care
Now I'm fallin' through
Wouldn't you?
Well, it's a long long journey to the other side
Oh I've been wishin' all night I was on that flight
And god, you'd better take care of the sweetest eyes
I hear myself swallowin' the tears I cry I hear myself swallowin' the tears I cry
7twenty7 is up in the air
You know I feel her hands
On me everywhere
I thought I didn't care
Now I'm saying a prayer
Hey mister, do you know the way
To salvation square?
It's a long long winter 'til the birds will sing
Oh I'll be waitin' all night for the phone to ring
I'm goin' up in smoke and phoney magazines
Everything is just pieces of my stupid dreams
Everything is just spieces of my stupid dreams
With the clouds passin' by
With the clouds passin' by
It's all right
7twenty7 is close to the sky
It carries the world
Between hello and goodbye
Like the Monday we met
That disappeared in a breath
Like the Sunday she left
Forever smellin' of death
Another jet black night, another drink to go
Oh I'll be diving my head in the pure white snow
God, you'd better take care of this gold skinned friend
Tell me, will I ever see her again
Tell me, will I ever see her again"
A Thing About You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/a_thing_about_you-lyrics-329171.html	A Thing About You	"I pick up the phone
I'm dialing your number
while I pray you're at home,
at home and alone
'cause I can't function on my own
And I'll never stop believing
The reapwork is done
You are the one
The radio is on but sound is all gone
And I wanna walk out in the sun
But lately that's been very hard to do
I've got a thing about you
And I don't really know what you do
'cause I've got a thing about you
Hey you
I pick up the phone
I'm dailing that number and
my heart like a stone
waits for the tone
Oh I can't make it on my own
And I'll never stop believing
I know what is right and this is so wrong
Alone in my bed, better off on my own
The TV is on but the colours are gone
And lately you've been painting my world blue
I've got a thing about you
(I've got a thing about you)
And I don't really care what you do
I've got a thing about you
(I've got a thing about you)
Hey you
I've got a thing about you
I've got a thing about you-ou-ou-ou
Lately you've been painting my world blue
I've got a thing about you
(I've got a thing about you)
And I don't really know what to do
I've got a thing about you
Hoping this story cuts through
(this story cuts through)
Yea, I've got a thing about you
A thing about you
I've got a thing about you...
I've got a thing about you...
And I don't really know what to do"

Step inside, take a deep breath, and do what you do best.
Yes, kick off them shoes and leave those city streets.
I do believe love came our way, and fate did arrange for us to meet.
I love when you do that hocus pocus to me.
The way that you touch, you've got the power to heal.
You give me that look, it's almost unreal. It's almost unreal.
Hey, we can't stop the rain, let's find a place by the fire.
Sometimes I feel, strange as it seems,
you've been in my dreams all my life.
I love when you do that hocus pocus to me.
The way that you touch, you've got the power to heal.
You give me that look, it's almost unreal. It's almost unreal.
It's a crazy world out there. It's a crazy...

Oh, I love when you do that hocus pocus to me.

Anyone	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/anyone-lyrics-15046.html	Have A Nice Day	"Anyone who have a love close to this
Knows what I'm saying
Anyone who wants a dream to come true
Knows how I'm feeling
All I can think of is you and me
Doing the things I wanna do
All I imagine is heaven on earth
I know it's you
Anyone who ever kissed in the rain
Knows the whole meaning
Anyone who ever stood in the light
Needs no explaining
But everything more or less appears so meaningless
Blue and cold
Walking alone through the afternoon traffic
I miss you so
Anyone who felt like I do
Anyone who wasn't ready to fall
Anyone who loved like I do
Knows it never really happens at all
It's over when it's over
What can I do about it
Now that it's over
Everything more or less is looking so meaningless
And fades to grey
Lying awake in an ocean of teardrops
I float away
Anyone who ever felt like I do
Anyone who wasn't ready to fall
Anyone who loved like I do
Knows it never really happens at all
It's over when it's over
What can I do about it
Now it's all over"

Be anyone you wanna be
But baby, if you come as you are
That's alright with me

Everybody wants to change their name and face
Everybody wants to be on TV
Everybody knows that 1+1=3
Be anyone you wanna be
Be anyone you wanna be
But baby, if you come as you are
That's alright with me
Everybody wants to be a man of the world
Everybody wants to watch the poor little rich girl
Everybody wants to sow the perfect seed
Everybody wants to be what everybody needs
Be anyone you wanna be
Be anyone you wanna be
But baby, if you come as you are
That's alright with me
Everybody wants to change their shirts and ties
Everybody wants the truth behind all lies
I can stay all night
Just to watch your eyes
Everybody wants invisibility
My mother still wants Ringo to come on over for tea
Be anyone you wanna be
Be anyone you wanna be

Are comin' my way
Beautiful things
I want them to stay
But after a while
My beautiful things
Don't seem beautiful at all
Terrible things
Like when you wake up
And all of your dreams
Seem to crack up
Like things you have done
Like breakin' my heart
For you it don't seem
Terrible at all
Is there someone I can talk to?
Someone on the line?
Does anybody want to hear
What's on my mind?
Beautiful things
Like leaves on a tree
Beautiful things
The sky and the sea
Since you've been gone
No beautiful things
Seem beautiful to me

When the rain is passin' by

Better Off On Her Own	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/better_off_on_her_own-lyrics-946215.html	Pop Hits	"My girl came home to me
Just the other day acting okay
I was reading alone
In my favourite room the TV was on
May I be excused
For not telling the truth
Cause she's gone
She said she's better off on her own
She turned her head
Much better off on her own
My girl knocked on the door
To the place I usually refer to as home
I died surely some tied
Should have dimmed my eyes
Small and surprised
And God closed every gates
The moon fell into the lake
Boy she's gone, adrift
She's better off on her own
She closed, then she left
Much better off on her own
Sitting naked by the window sill
Watching cars upon the hill
Am I sleeping? I was dreaming
For just a moment time stood still
Better off on her own
Better off on her own
Now she's gone, she said
She's better off on her own
She turned her head
Much better off on her own
She's gone, she sighed
She's better off on her own
The tears I cry
Much better off on her own
My girl came home to me
Just the other day

Oh - don't you hide away from the rain.
Oh - can you tell me the name of this game?
I got to get thru to you.
Behind the door, another wall, a lonely cry a call of the wild.
A dancing daze, an empty face, a crystal high a call of the wild.
And there is something that sweeps the dark, a lover's dart,
the call of a broken heart.
Wrapped in the night, behind these eyes, oh hear the cry,
a call of the wild.
I know her and in my mind I dream of her, how she aches without me.
I know her and every heart is a lonely hunter when she walks by.
Oh - can you read the hurt in my eyes?
Oh - don't you leave without saying goodbye.

Everywhere you look there are lots of people to meet
It´s seven o´clock,the breakfast treat
now the schoolbus is here,hurry up and grab a seat
all the dreams are tiny ones,another just has just begun on Cinnamon Street.
There was a boy on Cinnamon Street
the same age as me,we shared the curiosity
he won my heart cos he could play guitar
well he promised me heaven at once and later all the stars
but it all remained the same cos things can never change on Cinnamon Street.
I can hear my heartbeat the very first time we made love
life was a lazy rest in the sun
later we went dancing,staying up all night long
playing all our favourite songs,Cinnamon songs
na na na na...
I say goodbye to Cinnamon Street
springtime is here and the air is so dry and sweet
I walk in a cloud,the smell of cinnamon bread
it´s in my blood since the day I was born ´til I wake up-dead
and the sun is smiling gently,a funny shade of red-Cinnamon Street.
I still feel my heartbeat the very first time we made love
life was a lazy day in the sun
later we went dancing hanging out all night long
singing all our favourite songs,cinnamon songs:

Cooper	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/cooper-lyrics-15053.html	Have A Nice Day	"Cooper went out late last night
I heard the slam from her door
Foggy ways, November daze
All the white wolves were smiling
Cooper went out walkin' the clouds
She left everything in a mess
""Shut your mouth when you talk to me""
Her words were always so small
And there's a sound from the telephone
When can I say she's coming home?
Leave me the number you're dialing from
And may I ask who's calling?
May I ask who's calling?
Cooper went out, 3 o'clock sharp
I heard the bells from the church
Someone said they saw a car
Picking her up by the stations
Cooper went out and that's all there is
I'm just no one from next door
Everything will be alright
When all the flowers have cried
Then there's a voice on the telephone
When can I say she's coming home?
Leave me the number you're dialing from
And may I ask who's callin'? (Who's calling?)
May I ask who's calling? (Who's calling?)
May I ask who's calling?"

When you've found your man, make sure he's for real! .
I've learned that nothing really lasts forever
I sleep with the scars I wear that won't heal
They won't heal.
Cos every time I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the heart but then I hit the wall
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's the call, that's the game and the pain stays the same.
I'm walking down this empty road to nowhere
I pass by the houses and blocks I once knew.
My Mama told me not to mess with sorrow
But I always did, and Lord, I still do
I'm still breaking the rules
I kick it up
I kick it down.
Cos every time I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the heart but then I hit the wall
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's my real middle-name
It has always been the same
That's the call, that's the game and the pain stays the same.
I still feel the heat
Slowly fallin' from the sky
And the taste of the kissing
Shattered by rain
Comin' tumblin' from behind
And the wild holy war.
I kick it up
I kick it down
And every time I seem to fall in love
Crash! Boom! Bang!
I find the roses dying on the floor
Crash! Boom! Bang!
That's the tall, that's the game and the pain stays the same
That's my real middle-name
It has always been the same.
Oh Yea Oh Yea Oh Yea Uh-huh
Been the same, been the same
It has always been the same."

Crazy About You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/crazy_about_you-lyrics-15069.html	Room Service	"Ooooo...
I'm crazy about you
I'll give you all my love
Yes I'm crazy about you
Night and day, day and night
I'll be your heart's salvation
Hey baby, let's stay together
Let's make it now and forever
I want to show it and shout it
and tell the whole world about it
I thought it never could happen
I thought you never would see me
You run a lovin' locomotive
You make my needs very primitive
The more I get, the more I want from you, of your affection
When you're around, I'm in control, I feel a complete connection
Hello, hello
I'm so crazy about you, you know... baby
Hello, hello, hello
Yes I'm crazy, so crazy about you
C'mon close your eyes, honey, trust me!
I want to enjoy your body
I want to take you much higher
and play the game of desire
Well I can't hide
I'm getting hungry for a bite
I'm blinded by this obsession
I keep dancing like your possession
I'll wrap my legs all around you I'll show you total devotion
No need to talk Love will speak to you with sweet emotions
Hello, hello
I'm so crazy about you, you know...baby
Hello, hello, hello
Yes I'm crazy, so crazy about you"
Crush On You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/crush_on_you-lyrics-15042.html	Have A Nice Day	"I'm a zombie in the moonlight
I'm sleepin' when it's daylight
I really should be alright
But I'm feelin' kinda uptight
I'm messin' with a neighbour
Who killed my amp and Fender
He looked to sweet and tender
It's hard to tell his gender
Got coffee on the paper
My dog's an alligator
I want you now and later
I got a crush got a crush on you
Got a crush got a crush on you
I'm rentin' the wrong movie
I'm laughin' at the wrong guy
I'm drivin' on the wrong side
My brain is gettin' cock-eyed
The flag is never chequered
Can't find my F-beat records
God, give a little lovin'
The money's in the oven
Got dead flies in my scotch with ice
My talents always vaporize
I want your bird of paradise
I got a crush got a crush on you
Got a crush got a crush on you
Crush! Crush! We got a good thing goin' on
Crush! Crush! Such a good thing goin' on
I'm freezin' in the summer
I'm sweatin' in the winter
No middle in the centre
No colours in the printer
No treatment at the pharmacy
No lessons learned from history
No future in the factory
No meaning in the poetry
No changin' in the weather
No Elvis in the leather
I want you now or never
I got a crush got a crush on you
Got a crush got a crush on you"

I left and wrote this song cos my life looked so shattered
I thank the lord I'm still strong like before
I picked myself up from the floor and tried
I tried just a little bit harder, oh yea
If someone wants you to bleed and it feels like your're dying
Don't make the movers you don't need, don't cry, just say ba-ba-bye-bye and try, try
Try just a little bit harder, you'll survive
Try just a little bit harder, go ahead and try
Mondays and rainy days were in my pocket
I don't want to send them on to you
Bring them to you"

Living here without you is not an easy way of life.  I spend my time without you, I try to
make it all worthwhile.  Standing in a rainfall coming down from the sky.
Why should I cry over you?  Why should I cry cry cry over you?
I keep on thinking about you.  I've got no private pride to hide.  I've built my world around
you like a call without reply.  My love has lost direction, she's got the sun in her eyes.
Why should I cry...
Hearing your footsteps, loud on my stairs (a-walking...)--living without you.  Feeling the
sweet sweet smell of love in the air (I can feel it...)--living without you.  Kissing the face
that I see everywhere but I'm living without you, living without.
Why should I cry cry cry over you?
Oh, hearing your footsteps, loud on my stairs (a-walking...)--living without you.  Kissing
the face that I see everywhere but
I'm living without you, I'm living without.

Well, I can read his lips but
I can't read his mind.

He was one of the kind

Women ravin' wavin' hands in the air
Men were cheerin', children started to stare
The King he said he was the luckiest guy
He finally had made it to the European side
Then the orchestra got ready to play
Another song from the Glorious Days
Oh boy, did he look good in green!
Oh boy, did he did he look good in green!
Oh boy!
Hey! Let1s Celebrate!
The nation's joinin' in (I'll tell you all about it)
Hey! Let's party on!
The whole world's joinin' in
These were the days of peace in our hearts
No Major Tom was to be seen in the charts
No Sgt Pepper was found in your home
Just Colonel Parker countin' money alone
The King he sad he was a fortunate guy
Then he smiled and made every girl cry
Cos they all knew that this was the end
That things would never be quite the same again
Oh boy, did he look good in green!
Oh boy, did he did he look good in green!
Oh boy!

Every night I take him home

I always wake up alone
Oh, it's strange, so strange
What he's doing to me
Oh, it's strange, so strange
Did this ever happen to you
The way it has happened to me
The way it just happened to me
Every day outside my window
Always minutes close to eight
I wish he stayed a little longer
But his bus is never late
Every night we're dancing slowly
I play the music he adores
Like Sinatra then we're talking
All important things for sure

that's the truth.
You're swimming in a stream, o yea.
Fish are jumping too, next to you.
Suddenly you notice someone's at the door,
you could swear you've been through this all before.
Then she runs
her fingertips through your hair.
Your life has just begun.
Her fingers, they are everywhere.
You're floating light like air,
leaving the ground
and she shines on just like the sun.
You're gazing at the sky, o my.
The stars are out tonight,
shining bright.
You're waving to a cloud, bye-bye.
You're drowning in the smile of his eyes.
Suddenly you feel there's no time for a deal
though a voice tells you it's for real.
And she runs
her fingertips through your hair
and life has just begun.
Her fingers, there and everywhere.
You're floating light like air,
leaving the ground.
She-she shines on just like the sun.
It's just a sunny afternoon.
Somebody's singing songs of love, child.
You love a lazy afternoon once in a while."

Checkin' in checkin' out
Making love I like watching all your fireworks
I like it when I light those stars in your eyes
Just like fireworks in the sky
- yes it did...
Throwing some poems to the ports and docks
They were sleeping outdoors pushing all their luck.
They sent me a letter full of pills and thrills
Then they both got rich and moved to Hollywood Hills.
Yea they made lots of money playing folk guitar
Cos everywhere the boys went crazy just to hear these words of art:
Checkin' in checkin' out
Take it to the sky
Making love I like watching all your fireworks
I like it when I light those stars in your eyes
Just like fireworks in the sky .
They're coming to get you
They're coming to get you now
Coming to get you nowWatch the sky!"
Fool	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/fool-lyrics-15065.html	Room Service	"I was alone
I told my mouth to shut up cos I was talking to myself
like I always do when I'm stuck
Well, I was crying
You could be crying too
I was screaming throungh the window, I keep missing you
And the tears came down from the sky
And the rain feel hard on my eyes
Now you know what I look like, I'm feeling like a fool
I lose on my own, I'm going back to school
And I will pray, Hallelujan, you'll be breaking every rule
and come back to stay, I'm feeling like a fool
I really tried so hard to design my life
There's a big black void in head like it's been cut by a knife
Every time your name comes around this stupidity follows me down
Now you know what I look like, I'm feeling like a fool
I thought I could swim I'm drowning in the pool
And I will pray, Hallelujan, you'll be breaking every rule
and consider to stay, I'm feeling like a fool
Please, come back to stay, I'm feeling like a fool
I'm feeling like a fool in my heart
I'm feeling like a fool"

This mystery has taken over me - I know
You make the true love shine You go from head to toe
There's all emotions flowing over me - I know
You make the true love shine, eye to eye
Well I've had a love that once blinded me
But now it makes me wanna cry
Well her heart is soaked with such cruelty
Her 'hello' sure sounds like 'good-bye'
But I keep my head up high
I keep my love alive

From One Heart To Another	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/from_one_heart_to_another-lyrics-14965.html	Pearls Of Passion	"Echoes of loneliness, traces from love affairs,
will never disappear, always come thru.
I thought I'd never know the time to see you go,
two people turned into one, thinking as one.
A hint in the night, a touch of a dream, has come to an end,
we run from one heart to another again.
The rose of our love is withered and torn
and gone from one heart to another.
Sailing away to sea, the ships made of you and me,
they pass in the darkest nights and turn out the lights.
And I thought I'd never know the season to see you go,
two people twirled into one, being as one.
A hint in the night...
running running from one heart to another..."

Go To Sleep	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/go_to_sleep-lyrics-15029.html	Crash! Boom! Bang!	"There's a shadow on the terrace
A snow dance for the living
There's heavy weather on the way
I heard it on the news.
And life's a tough principal who won't reward the losers
Your name is on the tea-cup
There's nothing I can do.
But to wish you'd think about me before you go to sleep
And I wish you the best there is before you go to sleep.
There are tears without the colour
A million seas with water
An ocean full of people where shattered hearts can go.
And love's a golden ripple where answers are so simple
But the explanations are very hard to do.
And I wish you'd think about me before you go to sleep
And I wish you the best there is before you go to sleep
Go to sleep."
Goodbye To You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/goodbye_to_you-lyrics-14958.html	Pearls Of Passion	"Goodbye to you, goodbye to broken hearts,
goodbye to romance, hiding in the dark,
nights that leave a scar.
Goodbye to you, goodbye to empty cards,
goodbye to this ball of bliss,
I'm dancing from your arms.
And I fill the bedroom with silent visions of rain.
And I paint the morning with echoes from pleasure in pain.
I don't want to touch emotions, I just got to run away.
Electric blue like oceans, wild like lovers sway.
Goodbye to you...
And I seal the pillow and shatter dreams down the hall.
And I hang the heartache like pictures on the wall.
Can you hear the sound of angels they're playing hurting games?
Well, I'm a stranger when I'm leaving, I was a stranger when I came.
Goodbye to you..."

I hide in the dark.
I'm watching the rain.
You're out of touch.
You're out of reach.
What can I say,
I never wanted it this way.
Love sleeps all alone.
The cold telephone,
I know the heart.
Yes, I know the kind.
The kisses of fire,
turning to grey.
I never wanted it this way.
I always wanted you to stay.
Wash my pain away,
cause I'm half a woman, half a shadow.
Love always change with the trees,
the spring and the leaves,
the waves on the sea.
Wilder than light the wind in your eyes led me astray.
I never wanted it this way.
I always wanted you to stay.
Oh I need you, yes I need you.
Give me a reason to believe."

She wrote some letters, he tried to ignore. 
They could have been so happy together. 
They could have been so lucky in love. 
Sing la-di-dah, so happy together. 
They could have run the earth, the sky, the sun. 
She carried his ring since she left school. 
He knew she was precious, the prettiest jewel. 
She wanted a baby but he wasn't sure. 
He couldn't  make up his mind anymore.

If you feel shattered I'm sorry. For what I've done
We could have been so happy together. 
We could have been so happy together.

of every word you say
that breaks the silence
of an ordinary day.
Every look
that seems to mystify,
every single smile
that spins me to the sky.
It makes me wanna run,
it makes me wanna hide.
Cos you're the only one
that makes me come alive.
It's getting closer now and darker by the hour.
It only goes to show
that here it comes,
here comes the weekend
and I'm on my own again
with a Saturday in the rain.
Here it comes,
here comes the weekend.
The fine line from pleasure to pain
is making me cry.
When will I see you again?
Every breath,
every vision you make.
Every chance in love
you love to take.
Every move
that seems to alter my world.
Every dream
I've had about this boy and this girl.
It makes me wanna run,
it makes me wanna hide
cos you're the only one
that makes my love alive
and time is running fast into a new goodbye.
It only goes to show
that here it comes,
here comes the weekend,
another walk down that lonely lane,
another Sunday that feels the same.
Here it comes,
here comes the weekend.
The fine line from pleasure to pain
is making me cry.

Hey, I gotta know, did you say Hello
How do you do?
Well, here we are spending time in the louder part of town
and it feels like everything's surreal.
When I get old I will wait outside your house

Come on and sail the sea with me
Come on, let's go around the world
Maybe find a flat
Or a canyon house
For the season

And turned a different corner
It could've been someone else

I was so lucky you found me
My rags turned gold and silver
I could've been somewhere else
You could've passed by, could've passed by

The sun through the trees
Is there a better place to be?

You left me breathless
Suddenly speechless.
Within the hour we were one
Two total strangers kissing the moonlight.
Oh, you know I'm sorry I had to go
I'm really sorry it had to die
I'm really sorry I made you cry
Cry.
We fell in love between the nights
Of too many lovers and too many teardrops.
And fate won't resist some satin sheets
I was so helpless
Totally ruthless.
Oh, you know I'm sorry I had to go
I'm really sorry you're hurt inside
I'm really sorry I made you cry
Cry, cry.
Love is lifting you up and draggin' you down
Makes you go round and round and round
Time makes a stop then it's all gone
Funny how memories keep lingering on."

I'm Under Your Magic Spell	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/im_under_your_magic_spell-lyrics-15075.html	Room Service	"Like a light coming down, from the sky
Thundering Venus and Apollo
And my invitation of the physical kind
Out of control, I just tend to follow
You're close to me, like the air that I breathe
I touch too much, I never wanna leave
Seems I'm under a magic spell (Magic love)
Any way I try, I just can't hide
I'm under your magic spell (Under a magic... )
And nothing enough I'm on the hunt for your love
Holding the fire out of the road
Straight from the heart to the end of the rainbow
Turning electric, and going for gold
Body and soul, just has to follow
You're close to me, like the air that I breathe
I touch too much, I never wanna leave
Seems I'm under a magic spell ...
Baby for your love"

And I know, you know

On a one-way train going down
Can you tell me what to say
when there's no one listening?
Can you show me what to do
when all is done?

I know, you know
It hurts
It hurts to be alone
The plan has gone wrong

Touch me now, I close my eyes and dream away.
It must have been love but it's over now.
It must have been good but I lost it somehow.
It must have been love but it's over now.
From the moment we touched, 'til the time had run out.
Make-believing we're together that I'm sheltered by your heart.
But in and outside I've turned to water like a teardrop in your palm.
And it's a hard winters day, I dream away.

It's all that I wanted, now I'm living without.

No way to go wrong
All you do is blow that horn

Just drive out of town today
It takes you no time to get here and when
You've arrived you might as well stay
You might as well stay
Why don't you leave your desk for a short while

Stay in the sun, reach for the moon
Make a little love in the afternoon

I'm gonna pray for Jefferson
Pray for Jefferson's soul
I'm gonna pray for Jefferson

When him and me were runnin' out of time
Jefferson was sure enough left be behind

The neighbourhood would never be the same
Poor old Jefferson got the blame

Oh won't you move away

Is it all that you came for?
The joy of the toy got the look of a lie
The joy of the toy put the hurt into action
The joy of the toy
You can kiss this love goodbye
How can you win when you don't knoww
A thing what love is all about?
Don't want to fight so get out of my sight
I won't surrender now

Following the stars
Don't need no book of wisdom
I get no money talk at all
She has a train going downtown
She's got a club on the moon
And she's telling all her secrets
In a wonderful balloon
She's the heart of the funfair
She's got me whistling her private tune
And it all begins where it ends
And she's all mine, my magic friend
She says: Hello, you fool, I love you
Come on join the joyride
Join the joyride
She's a flower, I can paint her
She's a child of the sun
We're a part of this together
Could never turn around and run
Don't need no fortune teller
To know where my lucky love belongs,
Oh no
Cause it all begins again when it ends
And we're all magic friends
She says: Hello, you fool, I love you
Come on join the joyride
Join the joyride
Be a joyrider
I take you on a skyride
A feeling like you're spellbound
The sunshine is a lady
Who ROX you like a baby
She says: Hello, you fool, I love you
Come on join the joyride

Try the river boat, the carousel, feed the pigeons, Bar-B-Q.
Look at all the people, happy faces all around.
Smiling, throwing kisses, busy making lazy sounds
It's a bright June afternoon, it never gets dark.
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun.
Get your green, green tambourine, let's play in the park.
Wah-wah! Here comes the sun
Some folks are on blankets, slowly daydreaming
and reaching for their food.
Let's go buy an ice-cream and a magazine with an attitude
and put on a cassette, we can pretend that you're a star
cos life's so very simple just like la-la-la
It's a bright June afternoon...
There's a painter painting his masterpiece.
There are some squirrels jumping in the trees,
There's a wide-eyed boy with a red balloon.
All my life I've longed for this afternoon."

I hit the streets,
hey watch me in the monitor!
I saw a clone who looked just like a senator.
I checked the clock,
I felt that it was time to go go go.
Then came you.
Why did you keep me waiting so long?
Why did you keep me waiting so long?
Why did you keep me waiting so long?
I was a spy, I was captured by the enemies.
I made a million selling secret fantasies.
I saw my love wasted in a pale gray zone.
I was the quake shaking every monument.
I had to fi-find out what all the money meant.
I checked the sun,
I knew that it was time to go go go.

Love Spins	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/love_spins-lyrics-15078.html	Room Service	"Hold back the night
I wonder what she's doing When she's not in sight
I wonder where she's going Who she holds tonight
I wonder if she's sleeping alone
And hold back the pain
I cover up the teardrops In the pouring rain
My heart has been run over By a runaway train
I wonder if she's ever alone
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!
Her love spins like a merry-go-round
Going up and down, she's far away bound
Her love - expression of vision and sound
It's setting me up, and then it's kicking me down
Don't fade to gray,
I wonder if she's ever Coming back to stay
She's running on the edge She hit the harder way
I wonder if she's only a dream
So hold back the night,
I wonder what she's doing When she's not in sight
I wonder where she's going Who she holds tonight
I wonder if she's lost in a dream
Let it go! Let it go! Let it go!
Her love spins ..."

I wish you'll never stop to make my head go pop
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop every time you're around
It's a pleasant valley Sunday and everything seems to be beautiful
People go to church, but I'm found contemplating by the swimmingpool
I'm gazing at the sun
I watch him bringing joy to everyone
I feed the ducks with a ban only to find me in love with you
I wish you'll never stop to make my head go pop
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop
You make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop every time you're around
Press to play and never stop to make my head go pop
Yea, you make my head go pop pop pop pop pop pop every time you're around

No answers for the asking.
It's a long time - goodbye.
No mercy for the aching.
It's a long time - oh I see no light on the forsaken.
Never is a long time - goodbye.

Sometimes you laugh,
sometimes you cry, and yes,

It's you that I long for, it's you that I hunger,
oh you are the maker of waves in my mind.
We dance in the moonlight, a run on the wire,
drawing a fine line, a neverending love.
The fever turns slowly into a fire, drawing a fine line,
a neverending love.
Chasing your shadow, moon and the water,
field and the reaper, star and the sky.
Chasing your shadow, hammer and heartbeat,
clay and new concrete, I follow the signs.
It's you that I long for, it's you that I hunger,
and you are the maker of waves in my mind.
We dance in the moonlight..."

Something is melting this town
Like it was all made of snow
You turn me inside out
You turn me outside in
Around and up and down

Pay the price of love (ooh la la la)
When he calls for you
You've got to
Pay the price of love (ooh la la la)

December days of Christmas felt like days in June.
And there were morning lights, and sunrise chimes echoed all around.
Now's the time for weary minds, the moon is northern bound.
And you know I'm going back, going back today.
Back to where I came from. And you know I'm going back,
going back to stay.
To the alleys where pearls of passion came my way.
Well there's a promise in the twilight, it's so innocent and wild.
Two hearts that break the silence, you can hear a distant cry.
And there's emptiness and loneliness, it's more or less the same.
Well let's run between the raindrops, babe,
and catch the midnight train.
And you know I'm going back, going back today.
Back to where I came from. And you know I'm going back,
going back to stay. To the alleys where pearls of passion came my way.
And you know I'm going back, going back today.
Back to where I came from. And you know I'm going back,
going back to stay. To the alleys where pearls of passion came my way.
And you know I'm going back, going back today.

In that big old house
there are fifty beds

It's a bed of fear,
a bed of threats,
regrets and sheets so cold.
All I knew your eyes so velvet blue,
I've been in love before, how about you?
There's a time for the good in life...

I'm gonna come to you
I wanna find you
In everything that I do
I'm gonna run to you
I'm gonna count on you
I'm gonna follow
Baby, what else can I do?
Take a walk inside my dream: A church, a lonely road
All the people come and go and come and go.
Do it now!"
Salvation	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/salvation-lyrics-15051.html	Have A Nice Day	"I can barely remember my past
Everything seems to disappear so fast
But I recall being jealous and alone
Gazing at the dreams going by
I started my life when you knocked on the door
Found something inside I didn't dare to ignore
Now I do believe in flowers on the moon
I'll swim beside the golden tide
You crashed by the gate
Captured my fate
Salvation
My eyes couldn't see
I hardly breathed
I was diving so deep
Salvation
I'm down in the study holding on to my luck
Will you still love me when I call you up?
I gave you my body, the power over me
Come on, bring out the best in me
You crashed by the gate
Captured my fate
Salvation
My eyes couldn't see
I hardly breathed
My heart was asleep
Salvation
Some will get broken
Others will get lucky like me meeting you
Don't pass me by
You crashed by the gate
Captured my fate
Salvation
My eyes couldn't see
I hardly breathed
I was down on my knees
Salvation
Some will get broken
Others will get lucky like me meeting you
Don't pass me by
Don't pass me by
I found salvation, oh yea
You bring me salvation
I found salvation"

I'm leaving my heart in the palm of his hand
So gently
I know he knows that I love him
Though I've never said
Is there an easy way
See, see me
I've got nothing to hide
See me
I've got nothing to hide, see me
Coming home, I'm coming home
It feels like I'm coming home
Coming home, I'm coming home

you held it close to me.
The wild embrace, the silent sea,
a whisper of imagery for Lovers Supreme.
But now
I'm lost in the crowd,
no shadow of a doubt
it's all over now,
no shadow of a doubt.
You changed the dream.
You changed the scenery,
the tender touch,
the urge to breathe,
there under a lovelit sun
what's lost could be found.
But now,
no trace of a sound,
no shadow of a doubt.
I'm faraway bound.
No shadow of a doubt."

Barefoot in the summer, cold in stormy weather.
She taught me all there is, like magic and love,
lots of forgotten words
But now, she doesn't live here anymore.
She's off and she's gone, she doesn't live here anymore.
I'm sorry that's all there is to it, I'm sorry that's all
She dressed just like a painter, a female street Picasso
and I, I will remember the heaven in her laughter.
And the scent of her sweet perfume when we made love
under an August moon
But now, she doesn't live here anymore.
She's off and she's gone, she doesn't live here anymore.
She's gone since long, so long, she doesn't live here anymore.
She took off and left home, she doesn't live here anymore.

Fire in the ice naked to the t-bone is a lover's disguise.
Banging on the head drum

Loving is the ocean
kissing is the wet sand

oh give me just a smile...
Before I fade to silver,
Silver Blue for you.
Before I fade to silver,

I've turned into The Broken One

I want to give you all my love like water

The Pain - well, I can do without him.
And this is like the milky way, an ocean

Small Talk	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/small_talk-lyrics-14995.html	Joyride	"It's not the chapters he reads when you're feeling low down
It's not the touch of his skin when you kiss him goodnight
It's not the money he spends when you want to buy a daydream
And not that miracle smile that makes the sky bright
It's not the way his hands behave
When you've turned out the light
It's the small, small small talk that makes it all happen
Small, small small talk that makes you want to fly, yes it does
It's not the way he believes in you like a religion
It's not the thrill that you get when he's holding you tight
It's not the way his eyes persuade
You to stay the night
It's the small, small small talk that makes it all happen (just like that)
Small, small small talk that makes you feel like flying, yes it does
Information, heart and soul, a whisper, a word
Confessions that have to be heard
Small small talk
Come on now, come on now
Come on - you make it rock so heavenly
Come on now, come on now
Come on - you seem to talk so heavenly
Big words...
Small talk...
It's not the way his eyes persuade
You to stay the night
It's the small, small small talk that makes it all happen
Small, small small talk that makes you feel like flying, yes it does"

Darkness all around my heart.
I was alone but didn't fear
To wander in the light of stars.
In the bright and silent night,
Winds would knock and disappear.
Still I felt the feeling near,
Like the first time you were ever here.
You're so far away,
So far away,
You left me,
You told me you would stay.
You never said goodbye
And I'll keep asking why,
I keep on asking how,
Oh come unto me now.
I have breathed the morning air,
I have heard the four winds blow.
I was weary but prepared to follow
Down this lonely road.
In the room where lovers sleep,
Winds would knock and disappear.
Still I felt the music near,
Like the first time we were ever here.
You're so far away,
So far away,
You left me,
You told me you would stay.
You never said goodbye
And I keep wondering why,
I keep on wondering how,
Oh come inside me now."

Well is time to go downtown
To the agent man he won't let you down
Sell your soul to the company
They're all waiting there To sell plastic wares
And in a week or two if you make the charts
The girls will tear you apart
What you pay for these riches and fame
Well it's all a vicious game You're a little insane
What you get is the public acclaim

Seems its already morning
I see the sky, its so beautiful and blue
The TV's on
But the only thing showing is a picture of you
Oh, I get up and make myself some coffee
I try to read a bit but the story's too thin
Then I thank the Lord above
That you're not there to see me
In this shape I'm in
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you think of me too
I'm spending my time
I try to call but I don't know what to tell you
I leave a kiss on your answering machine
Oh, help me please
Is there someone who can make me
Wake up from this dream?
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too
I'm spending my time
Watching the sun go down
I fall asleep to the sound
Of ""tears of a clown""
A prayer gone blind
I'm spending my time
My friends keep telling me:
Hey, life will go on
Time will make sure will get over you
This silly game of love you play you win only to lose
Spending my time
Watching the days go by
Feeling so small
I stare at the wall
Hoping that you are missing me too

What's lost cannot be found
I can't return your tears
If I ever live to be a thousand years

I never wished you a broken heart
Coincidence put you down
He won't withdraw those tears
If you ever lived to be a thousand years
What do I have to say to make you stay?
What do I have to do to make you happy?
I'm staring at the ground
I wish I could bring the spring to your door

I gotta take it oh so so serious. -
Hey now, touch the sky,
you've got a certain kind of look in your eyes.
It used to be hard, so lonely at night,
well, she's my baby and I'm feeling alright. -
Hey now, move the sky,
there's a certain kind of look in that smile.
When I'm making love with her.
When I'm making love to her yea.
The Big Love... /"

The First Girl On The Moon	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/the_first_girl_on_the_moon-lyrics-15021.html	Crash! Boom! Bang!	"She was the first girl on the moon
She didn't compromise
When she took off that cold afternoon
Heading for the northern skies.
I told her I could come
That I could come along.
She was the first girl on the moon
I think I was her only friend
She brought her raygun, an old harpoon
Just in case of accidents.
I told her I could come
That I could come along
But she didn't let me come along
Wave goodbye
Wave goodbye.
She was the first girl on the moon
Standing tall, flag in hand
She looked around humming a tune
The strangest song known to man.
I told her I could come
That I could come along
But she never let me come along
Wave goodbye. Wave goodbye."

to tell me that it's over,
tell me that it's over,
it's plain to see.
And this time
we won't be starting over,
no crying on your shoulder
into the heart shaped sea.
Oh you've been a-running
from our door
and you've been enchanted
by the gracious voice of love.
Babe it's time
to look me in the eyes,
time to say goodbye,
it's clear to me.
And this time
I won't let you down,
you can turn around,
I'll set you free.
Oh you've been a-sailing
from our shore
and you've been enchanted
by someone from afar.
Babe it's time
to gather all the harvest,
to pray before the winter
and sail the heart shaped sea.
Oh you've been a-running
from my love
and you've been enchanted
by the powers up above."
The Look	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/the_look-lyrics-14971.html	Look Sharp!	"1-2-3-4
Walking like a man,
hitting like a hammer,
she's a juvenile scam.
Never was a quitter,
tasty like a raindrop,
she's got the look.
Heavenly bound
cause heaven's got a number
when she's spinning me around,
Kissing is a colour,
her loving is a wild dog,
she's got the look.
She's got the look.
She's got the look.
What in the world can make a brown-eyed girl turn blue.
When everything I'll ever do I'll do for you
and I go: la la la la la
she's got the look.
Fire in the ice,
naked to the T-bone
is a lover's disguise.
Banging on the head drum,
shaking like a mad bull,
she's got the look.
Swaying to the band,
moving like a hammer,
she's a miracle man.
Loving is the ocean,
Kissing is the wet sand,
she's got the look.
And she goes:
na na na na na na na na."

I've got to tighten my wire from the sense to the soul.
I find my back to the wall when it's time to go.
I've got to know
is that your heartbeat?
Paint...
me right.
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I,
I'm the pearl...
Paint your love all over my world.
I get a love shock/electric from the touch of your hand.
I'm getting lost in the riddles of the modern man.
I've got it up down all around tied to the bone.
Hey there's a strange situation on the late nite show.
I've got to know
is that your heartbeat?
Paint...
me right.
Can you feel the heat in me tonight?
Oh I,
I'm the pearl...
Paint your love all over my world.
Do it right,
I can feel the woman in me tonight.
Oh I,

I tell you now, there are no regrets.
In this room there are many memories.
Some are good, some I try to forget.
I thought we were the chosen ones,
Who were supposed to fly.
We're very much the same, you and i.
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye.
Still waiting to get hurt, time after time.
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye.
When love lies in our hands, we seem to run and hide.
And I can't help but wonder why.
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye.
My heart was like a runaway train, babe.
I don't believe I've ever felt more alive.
In this room I hear voices linger.
We never talked about the price.
You know you're not the only one,
Who knows how to cry.
We're very much the same, you and i.
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye.
Still waiting to get hurt, time after time.
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye.
When love lies in our hands, we run away and hide.
And I can't help but wonder why.
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye.
The sweet hello, the sad goodbye.
We're very much the same, you and i.

Sunday morning
I'm still hiding in bed
Listening to the rhythm of the rain above my head
and all that I have said
I sure saved a lot for you
But what could I do?
If I'd been talking to the wall
it wouldn't make any difference to you
That's the art of being you
I think I carry the weight of the world
sometimes you lose
the weight of the world
sometimes you cryyyyy
Marie:
I kiss your smile
I wish you'd stay the night
I put my arms around your golden head and turn out the light
Oh I love to watch your eyes
when I make love to you

There Is My Baby	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/there_is_my_baby-lyrics-511518.html	-	"I drive home late at night
Real tired
Got the radio blastin' high
I kill an hour on the freeway
It's so easy
Cos I know what's waitin' for me
I park the car in the yard
Got my key in the right direction
And suddenly she appears
In front of me like 1-2-3
There is my baby
There is my girl
And she looks so fine
Best thing that ever happened in my life
Sometimes I feel so alone
All destroyed
Cryin' like a baby boy
She puts her arms around me
Then she kisses me
And tells me stupid little things I adore
In this old town you're bound to lose
I was the one with my mouth shut down
So there's no real reason for this dream
To be there for me, to be there for me, hey
There is my baby
There is my girl
And she looks so fine
Best thing that ever happened in my life
In this small town you're bound to lose
I was the one with my mouth shut down
There's just one real reality
Waitin' there ahead of me
There is my baby
There is my girl
And she looks so fine
Best thing that ever happened in my life
Yes, she looks so fine
Best thing that ever happened in my life
Yes she looks so fine
God, she looks so fine"

No place to hide I got nowhere to run from you
Away from you

When we will ever meet again
That was then, baby this is now
I try to get over you
Losing you... things will never be the same
Can you hear me call your name?
If we changed it back again
Things would never be...
In your hand, babe, I don't understand
You've got the eyes of a child but you hurt like a man, always do
Always do
Touch me now, girl I don't know when,

I never really liked him but let's keep that between you and me
I ran into this woman at a crowded café
There's nothing else to say, she took my breath away
She said: I'm Prudence, I just came out to play outta charm school
How on earth could it be?
I'm touched by the hand of God
Really hard to believe
Hey, I'm touched by the hand of God
She's got a mind set on me
Yeah, I'm blessed with the power of love
The power of love, yeah!
Heaven in her smile, I took a break for a while with good reason
Drowning in her eyes, I was mesmerized, I'm buried and gone
I guess my kind of talking was misplaced like hell
Just like the funky? Art Garfunkel?
Hey, sweet Prudence, you're doing so well outta charm school
How on earth could it be?

Really hard to believe
Don't you know I'm touched by the hand of God

I see it perfectly clear and I cry for the dreams that you kill - oh oh,

no escape though you're soaking wet.
Leave me blinded by your light.
Leave me stranded alone tonight.

Her absent-minded eyes
And she has kept me wondering for so long
How this thing could go wrong.
It seems to me that we are both the same
Playing the same game
But as darkness falls this true love falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart.
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
I could never hurt the one I love
She's all I've got
But she's so vulnerable
Oh so vulnerable.
Days like these no one should be alone
No heart should hide away
Her touch is gently conquering my mind
There's nothing words can say.
She's coloured all the secrets of my soul
I've whispered all my dreams
But just as nighttime falls this vision falls apart
Into a riddle of her heart, yea.
She's so vulnerable, like china in my hands
She's so vulnerable and I don't understand
I could never hurt someone I love
She's all I've got
But she's so vulnerable
Oh so vulnerable.

Watercolours In The Rain	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/watercolours_in_the_rain-lyrics-14990.html	Joyride	"Going through the motions
Ending up
Nowhere at all
Can't see the sun on my wall
Going through emotions
Ending up
On a frozen morning
With a heart not even broken
Seems I've been running
All my life
All my life
Seems I've been running
All my life
All my life
All my life
Like watercolours in the rain
Find a place to settle down
Get a job
In a city nearby
And watch the trains
Roll on by
I'll find the falling star
I'll fall In love
With the eyes of a dreamer
And a dream worth believing
Seems I've been running
All my life
All my life
Seems I've been running
All my life
All my life
All my life
Like watercolours in the rain"
What's She Like	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/whats_she_like-lyrics-15024.html	Crash! Boom! Bang!	"Words & music by Per Gessle
Vocals: Marie Fredrikson & Per Gessle
What's she like
When she  turns around to kiss you goodnight?
When she wakes up in the morning by your side?
What's she like? What's she like?
The yellow moon or the deep blue of the sea?
Do you feel the same way you did when it was me?
What's she like?
Oh, I've been holdin' on, I've been holdin' on
For far too long
I've been holdin' on, I've been holdin' on
Much too long
What's she like
When you're makin' love and stars are in her eyes/
When you're lookin' for the answers in her smile?
What's she like?
Oh, I've been holdin' on, I've been holdin' on
For far too long
I've been holdin' on, I've been holdin' on
Much too long (too long, too long, too long)
I never knew I could love somebody the way that I loved you
I never thought I'd be the broken-hearted
Nothing hurts you like the truth
So what's she like
When she turns to you, when push comes to show?
When she whiepers in your ear that she's in love?
What's she like?
Oh, I've  been holdin' on, (holdin' on)
I've been holdin' on for far too long, oh
I've been holdin' on (holdin' on)
I've been holdin' on much too long
So what's she like?
So what's she like?
I've been holdin' on
Holdin', I've been holdin' on
I've been holdin' on
Holdin', I've been holdin' on
Holdin', I've been holdin' on

Wish I Could Fly	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/wish_i_could_fly-lyrics-15043.html	Have A Nice Day	"Halfway through the night
I wake up in a dream
Echoes in my head
Make every whisper turn into a scream
I dreamed I could fly
Out in the blue
Over this town
Following you
Over the trees
Subways and cars
I'd try to find out
Who you really are
In the middle of the night
Cool sweatin' in my bed
Got the windows open wide
Thinkin' about all the things you said
I wish I could fly
Out in the blue
Over this town
Following you
I'd fly over rooftops
The great boulevards
To try to find out
Who you really are
Who you really are
I wish I could fly now
Wish I could fly now
Wish I could fly now
I wish I could fly
Around and around
Over this town
The dirt on the ground
I'd follow your course
Of doors left ajar
To try to find out
Who you really are
To try to find out
Who you really are"
Wish You The Best	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/wish_you_the_best-lyrics-511515.html	-	"Stay forever
Stay a little while
I'm pleased to see you
I'm pleased to see you smile
September clouds
Shaped just like shells
September rain
Should fall somewhere else
It's been a long time
A lonely long time for me
I've missed your body
I've missed your company
There was a girl
Who looked just like you
There were some nights
You passed thru my room
And I walk around this small town
Like small town people do
You would never stay too long
Always passin' thru
Shine forever
Shine a little while
I'm pleased to see you
I'm pleased to see you smile
This distant dream
It might as well rest
I wish you peace
I wish you the best
Wherever you'll go
Whatever you'll do
I wish you the best"
You Can't Put Your Arms Around What's Already Gone	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/you_cant_put_your_arms_around_whats_already_gone-lyrics-15044.html	Have A Nice Day	"I saw red, stayed at home
Placed a big pillow over the phone
In this town where I'm from
I've learned two is so much better than one
But you left me alone
You can't put your arms around what's already gone
Watch you sink like a stone
You can't put your arms around what's already gone
Well, you hurt to the core
You used to kiss like no one had done before
And your taste turned me on
Now you drive me real crazy just by being born
Cos you left (left left left) me alone (left me alone)
And you can't put your arms around what's already gone
Watch you sink like a stone
You can't put your arms around what's already gone
Baba b-baba b-baba ba
Baba b-baba b-baba ba
Took the tram 'round the bay
Where everyone tells you to have a nice day
And my pride almost broke
When the tears don't fit you, you look like a joke
And you left (left left left) me alone (left me alone)
You can't put your arms around what's already gone
Cryin' eyes gettin' worn
You can't put your arms around what's already gone
Hey, you left (left left left) me alone (left me alone)
You can't put your arms around what's already gone
Watch you sink like a stone
You can't put your arms around what's already gone
Baba b-baba b-baba ba
Baba b-baba b-baba ba"
You Don't Understand Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/you_dont_understand_me-lyrics-15086.html	Room Service	"I've been up all night, you've been puttin' up a fight.
Seems like nothin' I say gets through.
How did this old bed fit a world between me and you.
We said ""Goodnight"" but the silence was so thick
you could cut it with a knife.
We've hit the wall again and there's nothin' I can do.
You're the one, yea, I've put all my trust in your hands.
C'mon and look in my eyes, here I am, here I am
You don't understand me, my baby.
You don't seem to know that I need you so much.
You don't understand me, my feelings,
the reason I'm breathin', my love
The mornin' comes and you're reaching out for me
just like everything's the same
and I let myself believe things are gonna change.
When you kiss my mouth and you hold my body close,
do you wonder who's inside?
Maybe there's no way we could feel each other's pain.
Tell me why it gets harder to know where I stand.
I guess loneliness found a new friend, here I am
You don't understand me...
You don't seem to get me, my baby.
You don't really see that I live for your touch.
You don't understand me, my dreams or the things I believe in, my love.
You don't understand me. You don't understand me. Understand me."
You Turn Me On	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/roxette/you_turn_me_on-lyrics-266057.html	Pearls Of Passion	"I wake up in a different daylight
Guess I haven't been around
See me follow the shadow haunting your body
Naked like water - shining like honey
Move me - You turn me on - The thrill of it all
You turn me on - The thrill of it all
You turn me on - The thrill of it all
I read in the paper how everything's changed
But it's all the same - it's out of the game
I reach out and touch an endless temptation
Live in a dream - the strangest sensation
Move me - You turn me on...
The lines I have written are the lines on your face
They merge out of nowhere - and leave with no trace
And I've had the feeling we're turnin' to one
When everything's said - when everything's done
Move me - You turn me on...
You move me - Oh, baby, turn me on"
