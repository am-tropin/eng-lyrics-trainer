30 Lives	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-30_lives	-	"Good morning my love
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have grown
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
'Cause thirty lives can be extraordinarily long
Lay me down
Lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright
Alright
Good morning myself
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you'll keep living and breathing until this world turns over
But lay me down
Lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright
Alright"
All Eyes	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-all_eyes	-	"Everything you say
Is just a lie
And now I'm leaving
To the city where the people
Are awake to chase a dream
That isn't real
And we 'posed to be somethin'
That we're not
Just wanna change a lot
And sign our name after the dot
Everything you see
Is just a century of anarchy
All my corresponding colors
That symbolize the things
We can attest, arrange
We can assess, we can attain
We are the intrical entities
To entice and entertain
All eyes
They're on you
Don't deny
You've got to
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me
Take my side
Take my side
Don't look back
I'm easy
And that's a fact
You're on my mind, oh
Everything you say
Is just a lie
And now I'm leaving
To the city where the people
Are awake to chase a dream
That isn't real
And we 'posed to be somethin'
That we're not
Just wanna change a lot
And sign our name after the dot
All eyes
They're on you
Don't deny
You've got to
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me
Now will the sun come up tonight?
Because your eyes they burn so bright
I'm all you've got
When you say
That you want
It all
You want it all
All eyes
They're on you
Don't deny
You've got to
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me
All eyes
They're on you
Don't deny
You've got to
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me
This is a call
That's all
You'll ever get from me"
All For You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-all_for_you	-	"I get caught in the water
I get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river
While the sun goes down 
I get tossed by the ocean
Piled deep in the sand
I'm drowned out by the thunder
Lost in a laugh
Is anyone listening
Is anyone around to see?
That I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go
I'm doing it all for you
I'm doing it all for you
I'm ready to go
I'm ready to go 
Ooh...
Ooh...
25 seconds, your heart will stop resting
Your body starts shaking
Your mind is not ready to go
Ready to go
25 seconds, your heart will stop resting
Your body starts shaking
Your mind not ready to go
Ready to go...!
I said, 25 seconds, your heart will stop resting!
Your body starts shaking!
Your mind not ready to go!
Ready to go!"
America	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-america	It's Time	"Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by?
20 years in debt
20 years in the government
20 years can never get me by
Then I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise
1-7-7-6
The names upon the list
For all the ones that gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free
And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Believe in you
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world, America
America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on"
Amsterdam	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-amsterdam	Night Visions	"I'm sorry, mother... I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days I'm fine - No these days I tend to lie
I'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin man
I'm sorry, brother... I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days you're fine - No these days you tend to lie
You'll take the Western train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin man
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me... I've tried
But I keep coming up short
I'm sorry, lover... I'm sorry; I bring you down
Well, these days I try and these days I tend to lie
Kinda thought it was a mystery and then I thought I wasn't meant to be
You set yourself fantastically, ""Congratulations you are all alone.""
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me... I've tried
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me... I've tried
But the rain won't fall for the both of us
The sun won't shine on the both of us
Believe me when I say,
That I wouldn't have it any other way
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it
It's hard, believe me... I've tried
But I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
No I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down
And I keep coming up short"
Battle Cry	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-battle_cry	-	"Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now
Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I have been poisoned inside
But I, I feel so alive
Nobody can save me now
The king is crowned
It's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now
It's do or die...
Oh
Nobody can save me now
The king is crowned
It's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now
It's do or die...
Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now"
Bleeding Out	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-bleeding_out	Night Visions	"I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you, for you.
When the day has come
That I've lost my way around
And the seasons stop and hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns gray
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating
Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong
'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow
You tell me to hold on
Oh you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong
'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you, for you.
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
I'm bleeding out for you (for you)
I'm bleeding out for you
'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is to bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin
And I count my sins
And I close my eyes
And I take it in
And I'm bleeding out
I'm bleeding out for you, for you."
Cha-Ching (Till We Grow Older)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-cha-ching_till_we_grow_older	Night Visions	"I don't sleep so well at night
Waiting up and shivering
Heater's gone and money's tight
In this little home that I'm living in
You've got to live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them
[2x]
Oh oh oh,
What is with you?
Oh oh oh,
I've never seen this side of you
Hey
We are all living
Till we grow older
You be the worker
I'll be the soldier
[2x]
I never hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
I don't think it's quite the same
Just running out to feel the rain
Staring as the stars parade
Are they telling me it's gonna be okay?
You've got to live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them
Oh oh oh,
What is with you?
Oh oh oh,
I've never seen this side of you
Hey
We are all living
Till we grow older
You be the worker
I'll be the soldier
[2x]
I never hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
(Oh, oh, oh,)
We are all living
Till we grow older
You be the worker
I'll be the soldier
[2x]
I never hear those sounds that sing to me
Cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
(Till we're older....)"
Clouds	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-clouds	-	"Oh...!
Oh...!
Looking at the lonely telegram, I crept into your room
Listen to the breathing voices of the ones around the tomb
The radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing
The people are explaining, but they don't know a thing
Give me a sign, give me a sign
I wanna die tonight
They say that London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for their turn to be dead
Oh You don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do
I can take a picture, you can be a picture
Stitched into my faded black
I can take you home, or you can be a home
We'll never look on back
The radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing
The people are explaining, but they don't know a thing
Give me a sign, give me a sign
I wanna die tonight
They say that London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for their turn to be dead
Oh You don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do
Oh, London sounds like a city of red
All the prisoners wait for their turn to be dead
And I don't want to die
No I don't want to die, Tonight
Come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in through the back door
We drift along the flooded sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying tears of sins
All dying
We're begging for a reason
Oh...!
Oh...!
Now come out, I'm waiting on your front porch
You came in through the back door
We drift along the flooded sea of muddy waters
Clouds above us crying tears of sins
All dying
We're begging for a reason
This year seems like a season
Belief in how we're living
Story with no ending
The storm is beating down
But we're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky
We're sinking to the sky."
Cover Up	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-cover_up	-	"There's lights that line these halls
That beckon us to stay
A glimmer in the distance
That gathers all the stray
And when I need it most
It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins
And helps me to hold on
It was a long night
We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last
Oh, the jury stole my fame
And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
Oh, you look so alive
Did you think that we'd cry tonight?
Oh, did you think we'd cry?
Oh, can you feel my heart?
I think I feel it, too
Did you think that we'd die tonight?
Oh, did you think we'd die?
And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
Take my love, take it to the valley where the golden dove
Flies it to the places where the silence screams
Fills it with the noises of our cluttered dreams
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want it's all we want tonight"
Curse	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-curse	-	"She barely knew your name
He was just a city, she's just a dirt road
but that never meant a thing
running from the country, she needed out but, he held that diamond ring
Cause I can't sit oh I cant talk
I gotta leave this town and run to you
curse these nights that speak your name
I gotta leave this town and come to you
break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
ha ha ha
break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
she barely knew your name
He was such a worry
no need to hurry
those streets are slick at night
she would never listen
she left it all and headed towards the light
oh your eyes look tired
but love was all she knew
screaming out in agony she gave her life for you
Cause I can't sit oh I cant talk
I gotta leave this town and run to you
curse these nights that speak your name
I gotta leave this town and come to you
break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
ha ha ha
break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
she barely knew your name
Cause I can't sit oh I cant talk
I gotta leave this town and run to you
curse these nights that speak your name
I gotta leave this town and come to you
break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
ha ha ha
break (oh) this (oh) curse (oh)
she barely knew your name"
Darkness	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-darkness	-	"I can never leave you when you’re lying in the bed
face to the wall
I slept on the floor
What did you mean by that
What did you mean by that
Take it as a self invitation
Take it as your own means of salvation
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back
Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it’s too late for deciding
Oh just leave it to me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me please
Cause I’m living, living
Living in the darkness
I could never beat it when you needed me the most
The more I try the less you try to come
How could I live like that
How could I live like that
Take it as a self indication
Take it as your own means of vindication
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back
Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it’s too late for deciding
Oh just leave it to me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me please
Cause I’m living, living
Living in the darkness
Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
It’s too late for deciding
Oh just leave it to me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me please
Cause I’m living, living
Living in the darkness
Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
Oh it is too late for deciding
So just leave it to me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Stay with me please
Cause I’m living, living
Living in the darkness
Living in the darkness
Please
Living in the darkness"
Demons	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-demons	Night Visions	"When the days are cold
And the cards all fold
And the saints we see
Are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail
And the ones we hail
Are the worst of all
And the blood’s run stale
I wanna hide the truth
I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside
There’s nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
At the curtain’s call
It's the last of all
When the lights fade out
All the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave
And the masquerade
Will come calling out
At the mess you made
Don't wanna let you down
But I am hell bound
Though this is all for you
Don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed
We still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come
This is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
They say it's what you make
I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul
I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright
I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now
Unless you show me how
When you feel my heat
Look into my eyes
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide
Don’t get too close
It’s dark inside
It’s where my demons hide
It’s where my demons hide"
Destination	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-destination	-	"I see the colors of the world—they're rearranging
The center sentinels are cunningly estranging all
I think a little about a lot I'm introverted
You think a lot about a little never heard it
All of our energy
I bring these words to life
We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination
Take me back to ninety one
I got a love life there, a loaded gun alright
I see the colors of the world—they're rearranging
The center sentinels are leaving but I'm changing
All of our energy
Bring these words to life
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination
Oh oh oh oh
We stay up late and draw the lines to every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied to age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination"
Drive	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-drive	-	"Get me right, all it takes is silent night

Emma	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-emma	-	"Emma stood in front of me
Tellin' me what I'm supposed to be
Jackie loves to run and hide
Give her love, and she will die

Holding you in carnivals
Baby is my love too old for you?
Baby is my love too old for you?
'Cause Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Dinner bells and loaded gun
Innocence is bound to run
Enemies are playing from
But don't you touch that golden sun
Innocence and sentiment
Is owned by hope it's where you're at

Every Night	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-every_night	Night Visions	"I'm coming home to you
Every night...
I'm the colorless sunrise
That's never good enough
I'm the wind that's in your hair
That ruffles you up
If you can find a reason
You can let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go
I'm coming home to you
Every night...
Coming home to you
Every night...
My mind is made up
Nothing could change that
I'm coming home to you
Every night...
Searching to find myself
But all I find is you
I can hardly stand myself
So what am I to you?
If you can find a reason
You could let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go
I'm coming home to you
Every night...
Coming home to you

My mind is made up
Nothing could change that
I'm coming home to you

No matter, no matter
No matter what we're facing
It don't matter, don't matter
'Cause the reason that I'm here
Is the same through all these years
Not changing, not changing
Anything at all

Coming home to you

Nothing could change that
I'm coming home to you

Fallen	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-fallen	Night Visions	"Run for cover
My sense of fear is running thin
Undercover
Just like a candle in the wind
Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming
Ohhhhh
We are fallen, we are fallen
Ohhhhh
We are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out
Every morning
I'm staring shadows in the eye
Oh, good morning
Will you just wait until I die?
Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming
Ohhhhh
We are fallen, we are fallen
Ohhhhh
We are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out
Tell everybody, tell everybody
Tell everybody, we are fallen
Ohhhhh
We are fallen, we are fallen
Ohhhhh
We are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out
I just want to take it in
Even when your fire runs out
Will you start it up again?
We are fallen"
Gold	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-gold	-	"First comes the blessing of all that you've dreamed,
but then comes the curses of diamonds and rings.
Only at first did it have its appeal, but now you can't tell the false from the real.
Who can you trust
(Who can you trust)
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold.
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)
Statues and empires are all at your hands,
Water to wine and the finest of sands.
When all you have's turnin stale and its cold,
Oh you'll no longer fear when your heart's turned to gold.
Who can you trust
(Who can you trust)
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold.
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold
(Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)
I'm dyin to feel again,
Oh anything at all,
But I don't feel nothin, nothin, nothin, nothin
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold.
When everything, everything, everything you touch turns to gold, gold

Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah
Ooh, gold, woah)"
Hear Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-hear_me	Night Visions	"Try to hear my voice
You can leave, now it's your choice
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back
I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Can nobody hear me?
I got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?
You kiss and you kiss
And you love and you love
You got a history list and the rest is above
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor
And the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is awry
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right, right, right
Can nobody hear me?
I got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?
Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away
Can nobody hear me?
I got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?
Can nobody hear me?
I got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it, too?"
I Bet My Life	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-i_bet_my_life	-	"I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I?
So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
Well I'm just a slave unto the night
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I've been around the world and never in my wildest dreams
Would I come running home to you
I've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth
There's you in everything I do
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
Remember when I broke you down to tears
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
I gave you hell through all the years
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I've played
Please forgive me for all I've done
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life, I bet my life
I bet my life on you"
I Don't Mind	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-i_dont_mind	-	"Did your mother like your Sunday dress
Astrology irradicated
So what, so what?
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not,
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
I'm not out for us to fly or be set free
So what, so what?
I'd show you, you'd show me, so much, so much
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not,
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not,
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
Your blood, it flows in from the western sea
Your eyes, they shine in through this shaded tree
Oh I believe in you
These places, they have changed
I don't know anything but you know me,
Oh, you know me
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not,
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not,
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

I Need A Minute	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-i_need_a_minute	-	"Welcome to the land of fire
I hope you brought the right attire,
The crippled man is waiting at the door
He said ""your eyes are much too bright""
The things you say are never right,
The sins of all the world lie on your head
So when you see me look the other way
Cause -ohoh- lately all I do is play
All the glasses in the world say ""come with me...""
[CHORUS]
I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
In a sin, considering my middle name is 'shake my body'
Take a seat it's glittering, I shake you in, I shake my body
Welcome to the land of fail
I hope you brought your soul for sale
The greeter's still at home I think he died
The land of smash and fairy tale
The truth of life is close to hell
The best you'll be is nearly dead or failed
So when you see me look the other way
Cause lately all i do is say
These the plans i make believe all come with me
[CHORUS]
Oh, perhaps it's all a dream and make believe
Oh, the last of all my dreams but still leave me
[CHORUS]"
It's Time	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-its_time	Night Visions	"So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain-check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top
Don't look back
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain-check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
This road never looked so lonely
This house doesn't burn down slowly
To ashes, to ashes
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am
It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Don't you understand
That I'm never changing who I am"
Lay Me Down	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-lay_me_down	-	"Good morning, my love
It’s been a while since we have talked
You have grown
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Thirty lives can be extraordinarily long
Lay me down
Lay me down
Again
My friend
I know it’s been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright
Alright
Good morning, myself
It’s been a while since we have talked
You have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you’ll keep living and breathing until this world turns over
But lay me down
Lay me down
Again
My friend
I know it’s been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I’m sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright
Alright
Again
My friend
I know it’s been a while since I could look you in the eyes
'Cause I am foolish and I’m sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright
Alright"
Leave Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-leave_me	It's Time	"Take a look inside
I've got nothing to hide - oh, no...
I'll be around the boys
I've got nothing but time - oh, no... oh, no
You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing is all I've got
Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up! I give up!
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run
So this is what it feels like
I'll give you the last word
It's alright... it's alright.. it's alright
And this is the town, this is the place
If you are the one to give disgrace a name
So be it
You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing is all I've got
Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up! I give up!
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up! I give up!
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run
I'll take my car, I'll take my house
I never liked that beated motor mouth
And it only looks so worned out then
Just like a stranger in the candlelight
Take take take take take it all
Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down
You've got the tendency to bring a man down
I give up! I give up!
You've gotta give a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'm shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up! I give up!

Lost Cause	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-lost_cause	-	"Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause
Wait, all this time that I have spent away
Makes me think that I might be okay,
The kiss of death will have to wait
My head, is holding on to all those things you said
You taught me to be strong and get through it, the mist of darkness
In my head
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause
Wait, no one said what's lost cannot be found
You are here to make it safe and sound,
Oh we, can make it, out alive
Fate, hath its way when all that's learned is sin
Nothing really matters in the end,
As long, as you, are with me, friend
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause
No one can understand me
Like you can understand
No one can fill your shadow
'Cause you are all I am
Oh, dig my shallow grave
It's not me you'll save

Monster	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-monster	-	"Ever since I could remember,
Everything inside of me,
Just wanted to fit in (oh oh oh oh)
I was never one for pretenders,
Everything I tried to be,
Just wouldn't settle in (oh oh oh oh)
If I told you what I was,
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seem dangerous,
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me,
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
A monster, a monster,
I've turned into a monster,
A monster, a monster,
And it keeps getting stronger.
Can I clear my conscience,
If I'm different from the rest,
Do I have to run and hide? (oh oh oh oh)
I never said that I want this,
This burden came to me,
And it's made its home inside (oh oh oh oh)
If I told you what I was,
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seem dangerous,
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because,
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me,
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
A monster, a monster,
I've turned into a monster,
A monster, a monster,
And it keeps getting stronger.
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me,
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
A monster, a monster,
I've turned into a monster,
A monster, a monster,

My Fault	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-my_fault	-	"I took a walk on a Saturday night
Fog in the air
Just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here?
I see my breath pushing steam through the air
Shaking hands run through my hair
My fears, where do I go from here?
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
Walking down to the water's edge
Asking why I’m here instead of home
Now I stand alone
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to feel it’s side
with his
like you were here with me
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
Oh, it's on the warmest night
It's in the brightest light
It's when the world is moving
Oh, it's in the faintest cry
It's in the lover's eye
Is when I need you most
And don't you know?
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
Is it my fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault?
We’ve been missing each other
We’ve been missing each other"
Natural	https://www.allthelyrics.com/node/1768728	Origins	"Will you hold the line?
When every one of them has given up and given in, tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align?
Will heaven step in will it save us from our sin, will it?
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge face up
'Cause you're a natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing
What's happening?
Looking through the glass find the wrong within the past knowing
Oh, we are the youth
Cut until it bleeds inside a world without the peace, face it
A bit of the truth, the truth
That's the price you pay

Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold

I'm fading to black I'm fading
Took an oath by the blood on my hand won't break it
I can taste it the end is upon us I swear
Gonna make it
I'm gonna make it

I’ve had the deepest rivers
You can have it all but life keeps moving
I take it in but don’t look down

I’ve tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I coulda gave up then but
Then again I couldn’t have ’cause
I’ve traveled all this way for something
I take it in but don’t look down

Pantomime	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-pantomime	It's Time	"You've got me feeling like a pantomime
That's why I only love you part time

Your friends all want me in the meantime
It's just a matter of ""oh, don't touch me,

Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny

You left me, baby, for another man
He's looking tall, he's got a deep tan
It's just a matter of ""oh, don't touch me,
don't you, don't you touch me no more""
He's got religious with the rhinestones
Takes care of business on his cellphone

don't you dare touch me no more""
Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed

You'll hear me singing you

Turn around and draw to my surprise,

I got a lot to, a lot hear.
I don't want to leave the puzzle, I'm done I got (a lot)

Radioactive (Remix) (feat. Kendrick Lamar)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-radioactive_remix_feat._kendrick_lamar	-	"[Verse 1]
I'm waking up to ash and dust
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
I'm breathing in the chemicals
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa
[Hook]
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones
Enough to make my systems blow
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
[Verse 2]
I raise my flags, dye my clothes
It's a revolution, I suppose
We'll paint it red to fit right in
Whoa
I'm breaking in, shaping up, checking out on the prison bus
This is it, the apocalypse
Whoa
[Hook]
[Bridge]
All systems go, sun hasn't died
Deep in my bones, straight from inside
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
Bury me alive, bury me with pride
Bury me with berries, that forbidden fruit and cherry wine
Thank you berry much, but tonight's my night and I'm Barry Bonds
Swingin' for the fences, barbaric Kendrick in idle time
Everything in life's subject to change, change whip, change grind
Change clothes, change opinions, right before I change my mind
I don't really know yah business, been in there since I was bendin' Lego blocks
Now you tell the world about me, dry snitch
Tater tots on my shotgun, now I gotta pop one at the stars
Sky's the limit, I gotta finish as the first rapper on Mars
Mark my word, Imma make my mark, even when they start their Marshall Law
Even when these martians alienate, my mental state is still at heart
Fuck, look in my eyes, tell me I died, tell me I tried, to compromise
Tell me you love me, tell me that I, don't give a fuck and can barely decide
Wishin' good luck on my enemies, all of my energy go to the almighty God
I could drown in a bottle of Hennessy, fuck your amenities, I'm gettin' better with time
AHHHHH!
[Hook]"
Ready! Aim! Fire!	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-ready_aim_fire	-	"Whoa
With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away (fire!)
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away
Off in the distance, there is resistance
Bubbling up and festering
Hey Mr Motion, make me a potion
Shake it all up with your mystery
How come I've never seen your face 'round here?
I know every single face 'round here
A man on a mission, changing the vision
I was never welcome here
We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way
With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away (fire!)
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away
Back in the casing, shaking and pacing
This is the tunnel's light
Blood in the writing, stuck in the fighting
Look through the rifle's sight
How come I've never seen your face 'round here?
I know every single face 'round here
Here in the heckle, holding the shackle
I was never welcome here
We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way
With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away (fire!)
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away
Whoa
With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away (fire!)
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away"
Rocks	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-rocks	Night Visions	"Where do we go from here?
Where do we go from here?
I threw some rocks up at your window
I broke some rocks right through your window
Timber, timber
We're falling down
Let the forest hear our sound
Boom ba boom ba boom
Ah ooo ah ooo
Boom ba boom ba boom
Ah ooo ah ooo
Why can't I see
What's right in front of me?
We fall
We fall apart
We fall
We fall apart
We fall
We fall apart
We fall
We fall apart"
Round And Round	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-round_and_round	-	"We are all living the same way, the same way
We are escaping the same way, the same way
Circling, ooh
We are a part of the same play, the same play
We think we're making our own way, our own way
Circling, ooh
You don’t have to hold your head up high
Round and round
I won’t run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for
We are afflicted by fiction, by fiction
Building a case for eviction, eviction
Circling, ooh
Guarding a tower of ancients, of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience, and patiently
Circling, ooh
You don’t have to hold your head up high
Round and round
I won’t run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for
All the emptiness inside you
Is hard enough to fill
Without a sense of purpose
We're setting up to fail
You don’t have to make it right
Just hold your head up high
Round and round
I won’t run away this time
Till you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I’m not gonna let you change my mind
Till you show me what this life is for"
Selene	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-selene	-	"To the top of all the world
To the tasteless underworld
To the center of your heart, oh Cleopatra is the only one you loved
To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation, tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
That's nice, what a metaphoric fall
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene
This is not what I expect, this is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears and now they're crowning me the Caesar
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through your tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene
This is my heart, it's on the line,
This is my heart, it's on the line,
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene"
The River	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-the_river	It's Time	"In the latest midnight hour
When the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise
And the world is at your feet
You gotta get up
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself
I'm not a selfless man
I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world,
Probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk
And myself
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself
Hold my place
Don't you give up on me
Hold on... Hold on
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,
For anyone but myself"
Tiptoe	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-tiptoe	Night Visions	"In the morning light let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them?
They never seem to catch my eye but I never wondered why
I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep
Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
From your slanted view see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them?
They never look to see me fly, so I never have to lie
I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep
Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Nobody else, nobody else
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else
Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Hey yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey yeah, tiptoe higher"
Tokyo	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-tokyo	It's Time	"Baby's got a lot of baggage...
It don't seem to matter, it don't seem to matter
Got a ticket for the mid-west, just for buisiness
but dismissed it for the interest
it was a risk just for a mistress that was a hostess on the west-coast
Don't you﻿ see it in my eyes tonight-ight-iiiight

Where do i have to go,
To find a hottie with a little soul?
Tokyo, Tokyo - Turn off the lights and let it go
Always nice to meet you

Tokyo, Tokyo - Pay in the palms of the﻿ rock'n'roll
Get that dynamite ...
Chicka-Boom on the down tonight

Now don't you see it in my eyes tonight-ight-iiiight

Father, father, father
Take me to the top

I love to be the underdog, Hey!

Uptight	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-uptight	-	"Say goodbye to all your friends
they will miss you when this trends
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
(hey) Sit tight green light everybody's out at night, go
why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it
When the current drags me in (when the current drags me in)
leave me to the hands of men (leave me to the hands of men)
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight

Warriors	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-warriors	-	"As a child you would wait
And watch from far away.
But you always knew that you'd be the one
that work while they all play.
In youth you'd lay
awake at night and scheme
of all the things that you would change,
but it was just a dream!
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town
From dust.
The time will come
when you'll have to rise
above the best and prove yourself,
your spirit never dies!
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above,
but don't weep for me
'Cause this will be
the labor of my love
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town
From dust.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town"
Who We Are	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-who_we_are	-	"Up in the morning
Up in the evening
Picking down clocks
When the birds come out to eat
Oh to eat
Up on the mountain
Down in the king's lair
Pushing these blocks
In the heat of the afternoon,
Oh afternoon
We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No.
It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
So won’t you save us
What we are
Don’t look clear
Cause it’s all uphill from here
Oh.
Up in the attic
Down in the cellar
Lost in the static
Coming back for more
Oh for more
Out with the reason
In with the season
Taking down names
In my book of jealousy
Jealousy
We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No.
It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
Because it’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
So won’t you save us
What we are
Don’t look clear
Cause it’s all uphill from here
Oh.
They say we’re crazy [8x]
It’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
Because it’s who we are
Doesn’t matter if we’ve gone too far
Doesn’t matter if it’s all okay
Doesn’t matter if it’s not our day
So won’t you save us
What we are
Don’t look clear
Cause it’s all uphill from here
Oh.

Working Man	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/imagine_dragons-working_man	Night Visions	"Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
So shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
[x2]
Every little bit goes a little of a long way
Life gets hard and I'm headed for the highway home, home
Caught up in the middle of a headache and a heartbreak
Just when I thought I was clear of the mistakes,
No, no oh oh
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What am I to do
I think that this life is darker than the view
So help me, help me, help me
Be a little more like you
When everything is falling
I'm gonna do the things you do
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
[x2]
Shake it
Everything is serious and everything is fatal
That's what they tell you
And that's how they make you know, know
I'm tired of the books and I'm tired of the tables
Everything is made with the same old labels
No, no oh oh
So tell me, tell me, tell me
What am I to do
I think that this life is darker than the view
So help me, help me, help me
Be a little more like you
When everything is falling
I'm gonna do the things you do
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
[x2]
Shake it
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake it, shake it
And we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
[x4]
Shake it"
