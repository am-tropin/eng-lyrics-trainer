Blue Jeans	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/lana_del_rey/blue_jeans-lyrics-1370608.html	-	"Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn
It was like, James Dean, for sure
You so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favourite sweater - and I know
that love is mean, and love hurts
But I still remember that day we met in December - Oh baby
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years.
Promise you'll remember that you're mine.
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby)
I will love you till the end of time
Big dreams, gangster
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, ""No please. Stay here""
We don't need no money, we can make it all work
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating, and pacing but he was
Chasing paper
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby)
I will love you till the end of time.
He went out every night
And baby that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side
'Cause I'm a ride or die
Whether you fail or fly
Well shit at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
I told you I wanted more but that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before
We were dancing all night
Then they took you away
Stole you out of my life
You just need to remember
I will love you till the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby can you see through the tears?
Love you more
Than those bitches before
Say you'll remember (oh baby)
Say you'll remember (oh baby)
I will love you till the end of time"
Born To Die	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/lana_del_rey/born_to_die-lyrics-1370609.html	-	"(Why? Who me? Why?)
Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
All my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping that the gates,
They'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets
Is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine
It's like I told you honey
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause you and I, we were born to die
Lost but now I am found
I can see but once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get
Scared that I couldn't find
All the answers, honey
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words,
This is the last time
Cause you and I
We were born to die
We were born to die
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough when the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh,
Let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
Choose your last words
This is the last time
Cause You and I
We were born to die
We were born to die"
Dark Paradise	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/lana_del_rey-dark_paradise	Born To Die	"Lana Del Rey-Dark Paradise              
                       Songwriters: Nowels, Rick / Grant, Elizabeth
All my friends tell me I should move on
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song
Ahhh, that's how you sang it
Loving you forever, can't be wrong
Even though you're not here, won't move on
Ahhh, that's how we played it 
And there's no remedy for memory,
Your face is like a melody,
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead 
Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side 
All my friends ask me why I stay strong
Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on
Ahhh, that's why I stay here 
And there's no remedy for memory,
Your face is like a melody,
It won't leave my head
Your soul is haunting me and telling me
That everything is fine
But I wish I was dead 
Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But that there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight 
Oh oh oh, ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh, ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight 
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams
Telling me I'm fine 
Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side
Everytime I close my eyes
It's like a dark paradise
No one compares to you
But that there's no you
Except in my dreams tonight 
Oh oh oh, ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight
Oh oh oh, ah ha ha ha
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight"

Baby you're no good for me
You're no good for me

Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Never was there ever a girl so pretty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Diet mountain dew, baby, New York City
Can we get it now low, down and gritty
Do you think we'll be in love forever?
Do you think we'll be in love?
Baby put on heart shaped sunglasses
Cause we gonna take a ride
I'm not gonna listen to what the past says
I've been waiting up all night
Take another drag turn me to ashes
Ready for another lie?
Says he's gonna teach me just what fast is
Say it's gonna be alright

Let's take Jesus off the dashboard
Got enough on his mind
We both know just what we're here for
Saved too many times
Maybe I like this roller coaster
Maybe it keeps me high
Maybe the speed it brings me closer
I could sparkle up your eye

Kinda Outta Luck	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/lana_del_rey/kinda_outta_luck-lyrics-1370614.html	-	"I was born bad
But then I met you
You made me nice for a while
But my dark side's true.
You never cared what I did at all
Motel singer at a silver ball
I did what I had to do...
Femme fatale, always on the run
Diamonds on my wrist, whiskey on my tongue
Before I get bad, I gotta get drunk
So get over here, pour me a cold one.
Babe you can see that I'm danger
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
Sparkling in sequins, say hey-yeah
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers.
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck.
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck.
Wrong, I know, killing someone
It gets a little easier when you've done it once
You know that I'm fun, you know that I'm young
So tell me you're mine and let's get it on.
Babe you can see that I'm danger
Glamorous bred, I'm deranged, yeah
Teetering off of the stage, yeah
I said it really nicely so can you be my savior?
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck.
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck.
I was a dangerous girl
You were too nice for this world
And now I'm back on the prowl
Who wants to give it a whirl?
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck.
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck

Off To The Races	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/lana_del_rey/off_to_the_races-lyrics-1370610.html	-	"My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
Swimming pool
Glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples, you
Sitting sipping on your black crystal, oh yeah
Light of my life, fire in my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire in my loins
Gimme them gold coins
Gimme them coins
And I'm off to the races, races
Up Bacardi chases
Chasing me all over town
Cause he knows i'm wasted,
Facing time again at Riker's Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden,
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you
My old man is, a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat broke down life
In fact he says he thinks it's what he might like about me, admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress, putting on my make up
Glass film, perfume, cognac, lilac,
Fume, says it feels like heaven to him
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you want me
Light of your life, fire of your loins
Tell me you want me, gimme them coins
And I'm off to the races, races
Up Bacardi chases
Chasing me all over town
Cause he knows i'm wasted, facing
Time again at Riker's,
Island and I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden,
Kiss me on my open mouth
Now I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is,
Tight and I am falling down
I can see your faces, shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you, but I'm going down
God I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlet, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
Sorry 'bout it
My old man is a thief, and
I'm gonna stay and pray with him til the end
But I trust in the decision of the law,
To watch over us
Take him when he may, if he may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way
I need you, I breathe you, I'll never leave you
They would rue the day, I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar of hanging from your lips
I said hon' you never looked so beautiful
As you do now my man
And we're off to the races, places
Ready set the gate is, down
And then we're going in
To las vegas, pay us
Cause you know we'll race this
Honey it is time to spit
Boy you're so crazy, baby
I love you forever
Not maybe
You are my one true love
You are my one true love
You are my one true love"
Queen Of The Gas Station	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/lana_del_rey/queen_of_the_gas_station-lyrics-1370613.html	-	"Give me coffee, king size cup
Come on kitty cat, fill 'er up
What's your name little buttercup?
That's for me to know and you to make up
Love casinos and neon reservations
But baby if you love me, take me to the gas station
Gas station
Look at you smoking in them neon lights
Under the thunder yo, you like so nice
Made me wonder how you spend them nights
Me, I spend them looking for men I might like
Like you [x3]
Love casinos and neon reservations
But baby if you love me, take me to the gas station
Take me to the gas station
Give me coffee, Utah love
I'm the kinda girl you dream of
I'm trying to tell you what I dream of
And that's gas stations
The Slurpee machines and organs playin'
Preferably, with smoking inside
If you can swing it (swing it, swing it, swing it)
And I'll be real pleased if we could find one just like here
Again...
Love casinos and neon reservations
But baby if you love me, take me to the gas station
Gas station
Gas station [x3]
Yeah..."
Video Games	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/lana_del_rey/video_games-lyrics-1370607.html	-	"Swinging in the backyard
Pull up in your fast car
Whistling my name
Open up a beer
And you say get over here
And play a video game
I'm in his favorite sun dress
Watching me get undressed
Take that body downtown
I say you the bestest
Lean in for a big kiss
Put his favorite perfume on
Go play a video game
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do
Singing in the old bars
Swinging with the old stars
Living for the fame
Kissing in the blue dark
Playing pool and wild darts
Video games
He holds me in his big arms
Drunk and I am seeing stars
This is all I think of
Watching all our friends fall
In and out of Old Paul's
This is my idea of fun
Playing video games
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do
(Now you do)
It's you, it's you, it's all for you
Everything I do
I tell you all the time
Heaven is a place on earth with you
Tell me all the things you want to do
I heard that you like the bad girls
Honey, is that true?
It's better than I ever even knew
They say that the world was built for two
Only worth living if somebody is loving you
Baby now you do"
Without You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/lana_del_rey/without_you-lyrics-1370612.html	-	"Everything I want I have:
Money, notoriety, rivieras.
I even think I found God
In the flash bulbs of your pretty cameras,
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras.
Am I glamorous? Baby, am I glamorous?
Hello? Hello?
Can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you want to see me fall.
Boy you're so dope,
Your love is deadly.
Tell me life is beautiful,
They all think I have it all.
I have nothing without you.
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you.
Summertime is nice and hot,
And my life is sweet like vanilla is.
Gold and silver line my heart
But burned into to my brain all these stolen images,
Stolen images, baby, stolen images.
Can you picture this
What a life we could've lived?
Hello? Hello?
Can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you want to see me fall.
Boy you're so dope,
Your love is deadly.
Tell me life is beautiful,
They all think I have it all.
I have nothing without you.
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you.
We were two kids, just tryin' to get out,
Live on the dark side of the American dream.
We would stay out late, play our music loud,
When we grew up nothing was what it seemed.
Hello? Hello?
Can you hear me?
I can be your china doll
If you want to see me fall.
Boy you're so dope, (so dope)
Your love is deadly.
Tell me life is beautiful,
They all think I have it all.
I have nothing without you.
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing without you.
All my dreams and all the lights mean
Nothing if I can't have you."
