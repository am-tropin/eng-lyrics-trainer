11 O'Clock Tick Tock	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/11_oclock_tick_tock-lyrics-18574.html	All That You Can't Leave Behind	"It's cold outside
It gets so hot in here
And the boys and girls collide
To The music in my ear
Hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home
A painted face
And I know we haven't long
We thought that we had the answers
It was the questions we had wrong
Hear the children crying
And I know it's time to go
I hear the children crying
Take me home
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
La lah la lah...La lah la lah...La lah lah...
[Repeat 4x]
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Call out your name
Call out in shame
Call out your name
Call out
You better call out
Call, call, call out"

40	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/40-lyrics-18472.html	War	"Sing this with me, this is ""40""
I waited patiently for the Lord
He inclined and heard my cry
He lift me up out of the pit
Out of the miry clay
I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song
How long to sing this song
How long to sing this song
How long, how long, how long
How long to sing this song
He set my feet upon a rock
And made my footsteps firm
Many will see, many will see and hear
I will sing, sing a new song
I will sing, sing a new song
Sing it
How long to sing this song
How long to sing this song
How long, how long, how long
How long to sing this song
Thank you, goodnight"
A Day Without Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/a_day_without_me-lyrics-18449.html	Boy	"Starting a landslide in my ego
Look from the outside
To the world I left behind
I'm dreaming
You're awake
If I were sleeping
What's at stake
A day without me
Whatever the feelings
I keep feeling
What are the feelings
You left behind
Today's a day without me
I started a landslide in my ego
Look from the outside
To the world I left behind
In the world I left behind
Wipe their eyes, and then let go
To the world I left behind
Shed a tear, and then let go..."

In the world I left behind
Wipe their eyes and then get home
In the world I left behind
Shed a tear and let go, no

On you
So small
Down there
From here
So high
We drift
We fly
Twilight breaks through
A different kind of blue
More lights
Blue signs

Down there
Tonight
With twilight breaking through
It's a different kind of blue
Twilight breaking through
It's a different kind of blue"
A Man And A Woman	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/a_man_and_a_woman-lyrics-219137.html	How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb	"Little sister don't you worry about a thing today
Take the heat from the sun
Little sister
I know that everything is not ok
But you're like honey on my tongue
True love never can be rent
But only true love can keep beauty innocent
I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
No I could never take a chance
'Cause I could never understand
The mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
You can run from love
And if it's really love it will find you
Catch you by the heel
But you can't be numb for love
The only pain is to feel nothing at all
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?
I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
And you're the one, there's no-one else
You make me want to lose myself
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
Brown eyed girl across the street
On rue Saint Divine
I thought this is the one for me
But she was already mine
You were already mine...
Little sister
I've been sleeping in the street again
Like a stray dog
Little sister
I've been trying to feel complete again
But you're gone and so is God
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate
When the soul wants...the soul waits ...
No I could never take a chance
Of losing love to find romance
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
For love and sex and faith and fear
And all the things that keep us here
In the mysterious distance
Between a man and a woman
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?"
A Room At The Heartbreak Hotel	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/a_room_at_the_heartbreak_hotel-lyrics-18559.html	The Best Of 1980-1990 (Disk 2)	"From where I stand
I can see through you
From where you're sitting, pretty one
I know it got to you
See the stars in your eyes
You want the truth but you need the lies
Like Judy Garland, like Valentino
You give your life for rock and roll, uh huh
Stand
We're on the landslide of love
You got everything you want,
And what you need you give away
For a primitive love and a ride on the mystery train
A primitive love
A room at the heart, heartbreak hotel
A room at the heartbreak, heartbreak hotel
A room at the heartbreak, heartbreak hotel
You say it's love, it's not the money
You let them suck your life out like honey
Turning tricks
You're on the street selling your kisses so bittersweet
I love it, yeah
Buy me again
I want to know pretty baby
I want to know
The price is too hard to pay
A primitive love and a ride on the mystery train
A primitive love
A room at the heart, heartbreak hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
Hallelujah, said halle-hello to ya'
Said Hallelujah
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
Hallelujah
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel
A room at the heartbreak, the heartbreak
The heartbreak hotel, hotel"
A Sort Of Homecoming	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/a_sort_of_homecoming-lyrics-18473.html	The Unforgettable Fire	"And you know it's time to go
Through the sleet and driving snow
Across the fields of mourning
Light in the distance
And you hunger for the time
Time to heal, desire, time
And your earth moves beneath
Your own dream landscape
Oh, oh, oh...
On borderland we run...
I'll be there
I'll be there...
Tonight
A high road
A high road out from here
The city walls are all pulled down
The dust, a smoke screen all around
See faces ploughed like fields that once
Gave no resistance
And we live by the side of the road
On the side of a hill
As the valley explode
Dislocated, suffocated
The land grows weary of its own
Oh, oh, oh...on borderland we run...
And still we run
We run and don't look back
I'll be there
I'll be there
Tonight
Tonight
I'll be there tonight...I believe
I'll be there...somehow
I'll be there...tonight
Tonight
The wind will crack in winter time
This bomb-blast lightning waltz
No spoken words, just a scream...
Tonight we'll build a bridge
Across the sea and land
See the sky, the burning rain
She will die and live again
Tonight
And your heart beats so slow
Through the rain and fallen snow
Across the fields of mourning
Light's in the distance
Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep
For tonight, at last
I am coming home
I am coming home"

Acrobat	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/acrobat-lyrics-18518.html	Achtung Baby	"Don't believe what you hear
Don't believe what you see
If you just close your eyes
You can feel the enemy
When I first met you girl
You had fire in your soul
What happened your face
Of melting in snow
Now it looks like this
And you can swallow
Or you can spit
You can throw it up
Or choke on it
And you can dream
So dream out loud
You know that your time is coming 'round
So don't let the bastards grind you down
No, nothing makes sense
Nothing seems to fit
I know you'd hit out
If you only knew who to hit
And I'd join the movement
If there was one I could believe in
Yeah I'd break bread and wine
If there was a church I could receive in
'cause I need it now
To take a cup
To fill it up
To drink it slow
I can't let you go
I must be an acrobat
To talk like this
And act like that
And you can dream
So dream out loud
And don't let the bastards grind you down
Oh, it hurts baby
(What are we going to do now it's all been said)
(No new ideas in the house and every book has been read)
And I must be an acrobat
To talk like this
And act like that
And you can dream
So dream out loud
And you can find
Your own way out
You can build
And I can will
And you can call
I can't wait until
You can stash
And you can seize
In dreams begin
Responsibilities
And I can love
And I can love
And I know that the tide is turning 'round
So don't let the bastards grind you down"

All Along The Watchtower	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/all_along_the_watchtower-lyrics-18497.html	Rattle And Hum	"There must be some way out of here
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion here
I can't get no relief
Businessmen they drink my wine
Plowmen dig my earth
None of them know along the line
What any of this is worth
No reason to get excited
The thief, he kindly spoke
There are many here among us
Who think that life is but a joke
But you and I, we've been through that
And that is not our fate
So let us not talk falsely now
Because the hour is getting late
All along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While horsemen came and went
Barefoot servants too
All I got is a red guitar
Three chords
And the truth
All I got is a red guitar
The rest is up to you
There's no reason to get excited
The thief, he kindly spoke
There are some among us here
Say that life is just a joke
You and I, we've been through that
And that is not our fate (at least today)
So let us not talk falsely now
Because the hour is getting late
Late..."
All Because Of You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/all_because_of_you-lyrics-219136.html	How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb	"I was born a child of grace
Nothing else about the place
Everything was ugly but your beautiful face
And it left me no illusion
I saw you in the curve of the moon
In the shadow cast across my room
You heard me in my tune
When I just heard confusion
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am...I am
I like the sound of my own voice
I didn't give anyone else a choice
An intellectual tortoise
Racing with your bullet train
Some people get squashed crossing the tracks
Some people got high rises on their backs
I'm not broke but you can see the cracks
You can make me perfect again
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am...I am
I'm alive
I'm being born
I just arrived, I'm at the door
Of the place I started out from
And I want back inside
All because of you
All because of you
All because of you
I am"

Always	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/always-lyrics-924467.html	7	"Here today, gone tomorrow
Crack the bone, get to the marrow
To be a bee and the flower
Before the sweetness turns to sour
What we have we're gonna keep, always
What we've lost we don't need, always
What is it that won't let you sleep, always
Be the arrow and the target
Put your head over the parapet
Be uncool, yes be awkward
Don't look in the obvious place
The soul needs beauty for a soulmate
Get down off your holy cloud, always
God will not deal with the proud, always
Well if you dream then dream out loud, always
Eternally yours, always
I want you
I want you
I want you
Touch me now inside
I wanted to be a man
I wanted to call
You say you come to know yourself, always
Don't find yourself in someone else, always
And always wear a safety belt, always
Wait for me I'm running late, always
This is the moment that we share for always
Turn each song into a prayer, always
Now and forever
For always"

A blackbird makes a violent sight
And when she is done
She sleeps beside the wild
Yes, if I know the truth about you...

When we touched the ground at JFK
Snow was melting on the ground
On BLS I heard the sound of an angel
New York, like a Christmas tree
Tonight this city belongs to me, angel
Soul love, this love won't let me go
So long Angel of Harlem
Birdland on fifty-three
The street sounds like a symphony
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme
Miles, and she's got to be an angel
Lady Day got diamond eyes
She sees the truth behind the lies, angel
Soul love, this love won't let me go
So long Angel of Harlem
Angel of Harlem
She says it's heart, heart and soul
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Blue light on the avenue
God knows they got to you
An empty glass, the lady sings
Eyes swollen like a bee sting
Blinded, you lost your way
Through the side streets and the alleyway
Like a star exploding in the night
Falling to the city in broad daylight
An angel in Devil's shoes
Salvation in the blues
You never looked like an angel
Yeah yeah, Angel of Harlem
Angel, Angel of Harlem
Angel, Angel of Harlem
Angel, Angel of Harlem
Angel, Angel of Harlem
Oh yeah, it's alright
It's alright"

The dawn of another dull day
Take up

Daylight
Mother stands in the hall
Last night
Head against the wall
Oh oh ooh
When night turns to day
And the children come out to play
Another day
Stop, shake out
They came my way
Oh oh ooh...
Boy, salute in a street uniform
Toy, soldier ripped and torn

And the children come out to play
Another day
Stop, shout
They came my way

And there's Nothing at all
Being naked and afraid
In the open space of my bed
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud
We lie...
Just as I am
I awoke with a tear on my tongue
I awoke with a feeling of never before
In my sleep I discover the one
But she ran with the morning sun
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
I'll be with you now
We lie on a cloud
We lie...
Another time, another place
We lie...
Another child has lost the race
We lie...
Another time, another place
We lie...
Your time, your price
We lie...
Another time, another place

Another child has lost...

You're looking fine, so fine, oh my
Dressed up like a lovely day, oh
Babyface, babyface
Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, babyface
Cover girl with natural grace
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy
Coming home late at night
To turn you on
Checking out every frame
I've got slow motion on my side
Turning around and around
With the sound and colour
Under my control, go
Round and around, going down
Dressed up like a lovely day
Babyface, babyface
Tin foil hair all tied up in lace
Babyface, babyface
Bitter sweet girl won't you give me a taste
How could beauty be so kind
To an ordinary guy
Do do do do do do do do do...do do...
Do do do do do do do do do...do do...

Slow down child, let me untie your lace
Babyface, babyface
Open the door, let me unpack my case

They'd tell you what I would say

Condemnation

Beautiful Day	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/beautiful_day-lyrics-18561.html	All That You Can't Leave Behind	"The heart is a bloom, shoots up through the stony ground
But there's no room, no space to rent in this town
You're out of luck and the reason that you had to care
The traffic is stuck and you're not moving anywhere
You thought you'd found a friend to take you out of this place
Always
Someone you could lend a hand in return for grace
Always
It's a beautiful day
The sky falls and you feel like
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
You're on the road but you've got no destination
You're in the mud, in the maze of her imagination
You love this town even if that doesn't ring true
You've been all over and it's been all over you
Always
It's a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
It's a beautiful day
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Teach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case
See the world in green and blue
See China right in front of you
See the canyons broken by cloud
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out
See the Bedouin fires at night
See the oil fields at first light, and
See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
After the flood all the colors came out
Day
It was a beautiful day
Don't let it get away
Beautiful day
Touch me
Take me to that other place
Reach me
I know I'm not a hopeless case
What you don't have, you don't need it now
What you don't know, you can feel it somehow
What you don't have, you don't need it now
Don't need it now
It was a beautiful day
It's warm in the sun, I reach to the sun"

Under her lie I hear her love

Finding out
I'm finding out the things that I've been talking about
I'm finding out the things that I've been missing out
I'm finding all the things, I lose my mind
Sometimes I fall behind
You and I
We live on the big ship and time goes by
You make up and I believe a lady's lie
Your skin is coloured strawberries and cream
Sometimes I scream
Boy/girl, boy/girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy/girl
We go out
A picture or a disco or a roundabout
I walk you home, I hold you there, you're giving out
I open doors so I can shut your face
Know your place
Boy/girl, boy/girl
When a boy meets a girl
Boy/girl
You can take me in your hand
Stand back, leave me, command
Up and down and all around
You walk sideways to the ground

Bullet The Blue Sky	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/bullet_the_blue_sky-lyrics-18485.html	The Joshua Tree	"In the howling wind comes a stinging rain
See it driving nails into souls on the tree of pain
From the firefly, a red orange glow
See the face of fear running scared in the valley below
The sky
The sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
In the locust wind comes a rattle and hum
Jacob wrestled the angel and the angel was overcome
You plant a demon seed, you raise a flower of fire
See them burning crosses, see the flames, higher and higher
The sky
The sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
Bullet the blue sky
And this guy comes up to me
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush
Like all the colours of a royal flush
And he's peeling off those dollar bills
Slapping them down
One hundred, two hundred
And I can see those fighter planes
And I can see those fighter planes
Across the mud huts as the children sleep
Through the alleys of a quiet city street
We take the staircase to the first floor
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door
As a man breathes deep into saxophone
And through the walls we hear the city groan
Outside is America
Outside is America
America
See across the field
See the sky ripped open
See the rain coming through the gaping wound
Pelting the women and children who run into the arms of America"

Slapping them down
One hundred, two hundred, three hundred, four

Across the tin huts and the Sarotista's sleep
Through the keys I unlock the door

The churchbells in town
They're rining a song
What a happy sound
Baby please come home
Theyr'e singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
Pretty lights on the tree
I'm watching 'em shine
You should be here with me
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
Baby please come home
They're singing deck the halls
But it's not like Christmas at all
I remember when you were here
And all the fun we had last year
If there was a way
I'd hold back these tears

The less you find out as you grow
I knew much more then than I do now
Neon heart, day-glow eyes
The city lit by fireflies
They're advertising in the skies
And people like us
And I miss you when you're not around
I'm getting ready to leave the ground
Oh you look so beautiful tonight...
Don't think before you laugh
Look ugly in a photograph
Flash bulbs, purple irises the camera can't see
I've seen you walk unafraid
I've seen you in the clothes you've made
Can you see the beauty inside of me?
What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?
And I miss you when you're not around
I'm getting ready to leave the ground
Oh you look so beautiful tonight...tonight
In the city of blinding lights
Time...time....time...won't leave me as I am
But time won't take the boy out of this man
Oh you look so beautiful tonight
Oh you look so beautiful tonight
Oh you look so beautiful tonight"

Comes the blackest hole
You had so much to offer
Why did you offer your soul?
I was there for you baby
When you needed my help
Would you deny for others
What you demand for yourself?
Cool down mama, cool off
Cool down mama, cool off
You speak of signs and wonders
I need something other
I would believe if I was able
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table
You were pretty as a picture
It was all there to see
Then your face caught up with your psychology
With a mouth full of teeth
You ate all your friends
And you broke every heart thinking every heart mends
You speak of signs and wonders
But I need something other
I would believe if I was able
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table
Where you live should not decide
Whether you live or whether you die
Three to a bed
Sister Ann, she said
Dignity passes by
And you speak of signs and wonders
But I need something other
I would believe if I was able
I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table"

Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car

Butterfly kisses up and down your wrist
When you see daddy coming
You're licking your lip
Nails bitten down to the quick

Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car
You've got a head full of traffic
You're a siren's song
You cry for mama
And daddy's right along
He gives you the keys to a flamin' car
Daddy's with you wherever you are
Daddy's a comfort
Daddy's your best friend
Daddy'll hold your hand right up to the end
A-ha sha-la, a-ha sha-la
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car

She is addicted to he
She is the root connection
And she is connecting with me
Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
She is sublimation
She is the essence of thee
She is concentrating on he
Who is chosen by she
Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
Could it be he's taking over me
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine
She is re-creation
She, intoxicated by thee
She has the slow sensation that
He is levitating with she
Here I go and I don't know why
I spin so ceaselessly
'Til I lose my sense of gravity
I'm dancing barefoot
Heading for a spin
Some strange music draws me in
Makes me come on like some heroine

Your lipstick don't fit
Your strap's coming loose
You're out in the hall
Waltzing the blues
Now you hurt somewhere
They won't find a bruise
You've been learning to walk
In those dancin' shoes
I had a mama
She told me 'bout you
She said true love don't lie
You touch that woman
And the smoke won't leave your eyes
You're talking your walk

Learning to walk
In those dancin' shoes
Now you hurt somewhere
They won't find a bruise

In those dancin' shoes"

And you don't know the half of it
I had a starring role
I was the bad guy who walked out
They said be careful where you aim
'cause where you aim you just might hit
You can hold onto something so tight
You've already lost it
Dragging me down
That's not the way it used to be
You can't even remember
What I'm trying to forget
It was a dirty day
Dirty day
You're looking for explanations
I don't even understand
If you need someone to blame
Throw a rock in the air
You'll hit someone guilty

In one life has begun
A work that's never done
Father to son

Get it right
There's no blood thicker than ink
Hear what I say
Nothing's simple as you think
Wake up

Slave to incompleteness
Slave to the suck and flow of the tide
Slave to the mouth open wide
Slave to coke
I slave to cola
Slave to the heavy bird, Ricola

I'll slave to Rome
Slave to the daughter returning home
Slave to Friday through to Sunday
Slave to swallow all on a Monday
Slave to the back
To welcome in the bones
Slave to the whispers

Slave to the rhythm
I'm losing control
Slave to wanting
Wanting it all

Do You Feel Loved	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/do_you_feel_loved-lyrics-39325.html	Pop	"Take these hands they're good for nothing
You know these hands never worked a day
Take these boots they're going nowhere
You know these boots don't want to stray
You got my head filled with songs
You got my shoelaces undone
Take my shirt, go on take it off me
You can tear it up
If you can tie me down
Do you feel loved
Do you feel loved
Do you feel loved
Do you feel loved
Take the colours of my imagination
Take the scent hanging in the air
Take this tangle of a conversation
And turn it into your own prayer
With my fingers as you want them
With my nails under your hide
With my teeth at your back
And my tongue to tell you the sweetest lies
Do you feel loved
Do you feel loved
Do you feel loved
And it looks like the sun
But it feels like the rain
Love's a bully pushing and shoving
In the belly of a woman
Heavy rhythm taking over
To stick together
A man and a woman
Stick together
Man and woman
Stick together...
And I feel loved
Do you feel loved
Do you feel loved
And it looks like the sun
But it feels like the rain
And there's heat in the sun
To see us through the rain
Do you feel loved
Do you feel loved
Do you feel...
Do you feel..."
Don't Take Your Guns To Town	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/dont_take_your_guns_to_town-lyrics-1119812.html	Sunday Times Exclusive	"A young boy named Billy Joe
Restless on the farm
A boy filled with wanderlust
Who never really meant no harm
Bill changed his clothes and he shined his boots
And he combed his dark hair down
But his mama cried as he walked away
Don't take your guns to town
Don't take your guns to town
Don't take your guns to town
He laughed and kissed his mom and said
Your Billy Joe, he's the man
I can shoot as quick, I can shoot as straight
As anyone can
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause
Or gun nobody down
But she cried again as he rode away
Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home
Don't take your guns to town
Well, he drank his first strong liquor then
To calm his shaking hands
And he tried, he tried to tell himself
At last he had become a man
A dusty cowpoke stood at his side
Began to laugh him down
And he heard again his mother's words
Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home
Don't take your guns to town
Don't take your guns
Don't take your guns to town
Don't take your guns
Don't take your guns to town
Filled with rage, then Billy Joe
Reached for his gun to draw
But the stranger drew his gun and fired
Before he even saw
As Billy Joe fell to the floor
The crowd all gathered ?round
And wondered at his final words
Don't take your guns to town, son
Leave your guns at home
Don't take your guns to town"

You know I'll be there

I'll cross the sky for your love
For I have promised
Oh, to be with you tonight
And for the time that will come
Take my hand
You know I'll be there
If you can
I'll cross the sky for your love
And I understand
These winds and tides
This change of times
Won't drag you away
Hold on, and hold on tightly
Hold on, and don't let go
Of my love
The storms will pass (the storm will pass)
It won't be long now (it won't be long now)
His love will last
His love will last...forever
Take my hand
You know I'll be there
If you can
I'll cross the sky for your love
Give you what I hold dear
Hold on, hold on tightly
Hold on, hold on tightly
Rise up, rise up
With wings like eagles
You run, you run
You run and not grow weary
(take my hand, take my hand)
Hold on, and hold on tightly
Hold on, hold on tightly
To this love...last forever
To this love...last forever
Take my hand
Take my hand..."

Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed
And the day, it is breaking
On rainy days we go swimming out
On rainy days swimming in the sound
On rainy days we go swimming out
You're in my mind all of the time
I know that's not enough
If the sky can crack
There must be some way back
For love and only love
Car alarm won't let you back to sleep
You're kept awake dreaming someone else's dream
Coffee's cold but it'll get you through
Compromise, that's nothing new to you
Let's see colours that have never been seen
Let's go to places no one else has been
You're in my mind all of the time
I know that's not enough
Well, if the sky can crack there must be some way back
To love and only love

Baby don't cry
It's hot as hell, honey, in this room

Need the rain to wash away our bad luck

I believe in the cells of Mountjoy there is an honest man
And you can go there too
And you can go, go, go, go

Elvis Presley And America	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/elvis_presley_and_america-lyrics-18480.html	The Unforgettable Fire	"(Black flash)
Black flash over my own love
Tell me of my eyes
Black flash come though my own life
Telling these things
And I believe them
And I believe in you
White flash sees the sky
And it turns its side from you
She won't turn my back
And I know you turn so blue
And you know
And your sky is feeling blue
And your heart
So cold when I'm with you
And you feel
Like no one told you to
And your time is your side
And your time with me
Ah, don't talk to me
Ah, don't talk to me
Don't talk to me
You know
Like no one told you how
But you know
Though the king that howls has howled
But you feel like sentimental
But you don't care
If I just share it in your heart
(Heart...)
Hopelessly
So hopelessly
I'm breaking through for you and me
And you don't
Though no one told you to
And you found out
Where you were going, where to
You're through with me
But I know that you will be back
For more
And you know
And though no one told you so
And you know, blue sky
Like a harder shade of blue
And you walk
When you want
To let go
Me, I'm the outside, tell me fade away
Drop me down but don't break me
In your sleep
In your sleep, inside
It's in your heart and mine
Whole sea is dark
It's in your heart and mine
Sweetly, those will come
Loving is on your side walking through
So let me in your heart
Your beat is like something...
They...
Run...
See say you're sad and reach by
So say you're sad above beside
Oh stay sad above beside
So stay sad above we said
You know I don't
No one told you how
(And you don't)
(And you wipe sweat off your white brow)
And you care
And no one told you tried
And your heart
Is left out from the side
And the rain beats down
And the shame goes down
And this rain keeps on coming down
And this sky
Tonight...
You know ""S"" ""O"" ""N"" ""G"", why
You're going go join to God
You know ""S"" ""O"" ""N"" ""G"", why
Give away some him no lie
Give away some my de day no
You know
And though no one told you sky
And you feel
Like you pretend you can
You say go, you live
Go live outside of me
Don't you leave
Don't leave out part of me
Then I can feel
Like I feel before
Like I hurt now
And I see the floor
If you pick me up
Bits and pieces on this floor"

You won't regret, I'll come back beggin' you
Don't you forget , welcome love you once knew
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, gonna be my bride
You'll never be denied, everlasting love

Feel the love you got, everlasting love

You won't regret, I'll come back beggin' you
Don't you forget, welcome love you once knew
Where life's river flows no one really knows
Till someone's there to show the way to lasting love
Like the sun that shines, endlessly it shines
You always will be mine, eternal love
When the other loves went wrong, ours would still be strong
We have our very own everlasting love
This love will last forever
This love will last forever
Open up your eyes, then you'll realize
Here I stand with my everlasting love
Need you by my side, gonna be my bride
You'll never be denied everlasting love

Exit	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/exit-lyrics-18491.html	The Joshua Tree	"You know he got the cure
You know he went astray
He used to stay awake
To drive the dreams he had away
He wanted to believe
In the hands of love
His head it felt heavy
As he cut across the land
A dog started crying
Like a broken hearted man
At the howling wind
At the howling wind
He went deeper into black
Deeper into white
Could see the stars shining
Like nails in the night
He felt the healing
Healing, healing
Healing hands of love
Like the stars shiny shiny
From above
Hand in the pocket
Finger on the steel
The pistol weighed heavy
His heart he could feel
Was beating, beating
Beating, beating oh my love
Oh my love, oh my love
Oh my love
My love
Saw the hands that build
Can also pull down
The hands of love"
Falling At Your Feet	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/falling_at_your_feet-lyrics-518049.html	The Million Dollar Hotel Ost	"Every chip from every cup
Every promise given up
Every reason that's not enough
Is falling, falling at your feet
Every band elastic limit
Every race when there's nothing in it
Every winner that's lost a ticket
Is falling, falling at your feet
I've come crawling, falling at your feet
Every one who needs a friend
Every life that has no end
Every knee not ready to bend
Is falling, falling at your feet
I've come crawling, now I'm falling at your feet
All fall down
All the manic days, faces that pull
All fall down
All the x-rays not under your control
All fall down
The graphiti running down for futile
All fall down
And the compromise you make for someone
Every teenager with acne
Every face that's spoiled by beauty
Ever adult tamed by duty
Are all falling at your feet
Every foot in every face
Every cop stop who finds the grace
Every prisoner in the maze
Every hand that needs an ace
Is falling, falling at your feet
I've come crawling, I'm falling at your feet
All fall down
All the books you never read
All fall down
Just started
All fall down
All the meals you rushed
All fall down
And never tasted
Every eye closed by a bruise
Every plan that just can't lose
Every pop star hurling abuse
Every drunk back on the booze
All falling at your feet
I'm falling at your feet
All fall down
All the information
All fall down
All the big ideas
All fall down
All the radio waves
All fall down
Electronic seas
All fall down
How to navigate
All fall down
How to simply be
All fall down
The truth knows when to wait
All fall down
Explained simplicity
All fall down
In whom shall I trust
All fall down
How might I be still
All fall down
Teach me to surrender
Not my will
Thy will"
Fast Cars	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/fast_cars-lyrics-219142.html	How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb	"My cell is ringing
No ID
I need to know who’s calling
My garden’s overgrown
I go out on my belly crawling
I got CCTV, pornography, CNBC
I got the nightly news
To get to know the enemy
All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to get right next to you
All I want is your face in a locket
Picture in my pocket
I take a pill to stop it
I know these fast cars
Will do me no good
I’m going nowhere
Where I am it is a lot of fun
They’re in the desert to dismantle an atomic bomb
I watch them channel hop
Check the stocks
I’m in detox
I want the lot of what you’ve got
If what you’ve got can make this stop
All I want is a picture of you
All I want is to be right next to you
All I want is your picture in a locket
Your face in my pocket
Take a pill to stop it
I know these fast cars
Will do me no good
Don’t you worry about your mind
Don’t you worry about your mind
Don’t you worry about your mind
Don’t you worry about your mind
You should worry about the day
That the pain it goes away
You know I miss mine sometimes
There is no fiction
That will truly fit the situation
I’m documenting every detail
Every conversation
I’m not used to talking to somebody in their body
Look, there’s somebody in a body, somebody in a body"

There's a fire in me when I call out

Success is to give
Don't believe in riches

I...I believe in love
Don't believe in forced entry
Don't believe in rape

Wild thoughts escape
I don't believe in death row
Skid row or the gangs
Don't believe in the Uzi
It just went off in my hand
I...I believe in love

Got a speed-ball in my head
I could cut and crack you open
Do you hear what I said
Don't believe them when they tell me
There ain't no cure

The sick stay poor
I...I believe in love
Don't believe in Goldman
His type like a curse
Instant karma's going to get him
If I don't get him first
Don't believe in rock 'n' roll
Can really change the world
As it spins in revolution
It spirals and turns
I...I believe in love
Don't believe in the 60's
The golden age of pop
You glorify the past
When the future dries up
Heard a singer on the radio late last night
He says he's gonna kick the darkness
'til it bleeds daylight
I...I believe in love
I feel like I'm falling
Like I'm spinning on a wheel
It always stops beside of me
With a presence I can feel
I...I believe in love"

She takes the blame
She covers the shame
Removes the stain

Grace
It's a name for a girl
It's also a thought that
Changed the world
And when she walks on the street
You can hear the strings
Grace finds goodness
In everything
Grace
She's got the walk
Not on a wrapper on chalk
She's got the time to talk
She travels outside
Of karma, karma
She travels outside
Of karma
When she goes to work
You can hear the strings
Grace finds beauty
In everything
Grace
She carries a world on her hips
No champagne flute for her lips
No twirls or skips
Between her fingertips
She carries a pearl
In perfect condition
What once was hers
What once was friction
What left a mark
No longer stains
Because grace makes beauty
Out of ugly things
Grace finds beauty
In everything
Grace finds goodness
In everything"

Hands That Built America	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/hands_that_built_america-lyrics-328349.html	Best of 1990-2000	"Oh my love
It's a long way we've come
From the freckled hills to the steel and glass canyons
From the stony fields, to hanging steel from the sky
From digging in our pockets, for a reason not to say goodbye
These are the hands that built America
Russian, Sioux, Dutch, Hindu
Polish, Irish, German, Italian
I last saw your face in a watercolour sky
As sea birds argued a long goodbye
I took your kiss on the spray of the new line star
You gotta live with your dreams
Don't make them so hard
And these are the hands that built America
These are the hands that built America
The Irish, the Blacks, the Chinese, the Jews
Korean, Hispanic, Muslim, Indian
Of all of the promises
Is this one we can keep?
Of all of the dreams
Is this one still out of reach?
Its early fall
There's a cloud on the New York skyline
Innocence dragged across a yellow line
These are the hands that built America
These are the hands that built America"

Heartland	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/heartland-lyrics-18505.html	Rattle And Hum	"See the sun rise over her skin
Don't change it
See the sun rise over her skin
Dawn changes everything
Everything
And the delta sun
Burns bright and violet
Mississippi and the cotton wool heat
Sixty-six a highway speaks
Of deserts dry
Of cool green valleys
Gold and silver veins
Of the shining cities
In this heartland
In this heartland soil
In this heartland
Heaven knows this is a heartland
Heartland...heartland
See the sun rise over her skin
She feels like water in my hand
Freeway like a river cuts through this land
Into the side of love
Like a burning spear
And the poison rain
Brings a flood of fear
Through the ghost-ranch hills
Death valley waters
In the towers of steel
Belief goes on and on
In this heartland
In this heartland soil
In this heartland
Heaven knows this is a heartland
Heartland...heaven knows this is a heartland
Heartland...heartland
Heartland...heaven's day here in the heartland
Heart..."
Helter Skelter	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/helter_skelter-lyrics-18493.html	Rattle And Hum	"When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop and I turn
And I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom
And I see you again
Do you, don't you want me to love you?
I'm coming down fast, but I'm miles above you
Tell me, tell me, tell me, come on tell me the answer
Well, you may be a lover, but you ain't no dancer.
Helter skelter, helter skelter
Helter skelter"

Gonna walk in the sun

Felt the healing in her fingertips
It burned like fire

I have spoke with the tongue of angels
I have held the hand of a devil
It was warm in the night
I was cold as a stone
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
But I still haven't found what I'm looking for
I believe in the kingdom come
Then all the colors will bleed into one
Bleed into one
Well, yes, I'm still running
You broke the bonds and you
Loosed the chains
Carried the cross
And my shame
All my shame
You know I believe it

I've got you deep in the heart of me
So deep in my heart
You're nearly a part of me
I've got you under my skin
I have tried so not to give in
I have said to myself this affair
Never gonna go somewhere
But why should I try to resist
When baby I know so well
That I've got you under my skin
I would sacrafice anything
Come what might
For the sake of holding you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
It repeats and it shouts in my ear
Don't you know blue-eyes
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
But each time I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin
'cause I've got you under my skin
I'd sacrafice anything
Come what might
For the sake of having you near
In spite of a warning voice
That comes in the night
It repeats and it shouts in my ear
Don't you know you old fool
You never can win
Use your mentality
Wake up to reality
But each time that I do
Just the thought of you
Makes me stop before I begin

And I love you (when you're) under my skin"

Would everything be alright?
God has got his phone off the hook
Babe would he even pick up if he could?

Hangin' round this neighbourhood
See his mother dealing in a doorway
See Father Christmas with a begging bowl

It's the cops collecting for the cons
So where is the hope and where is the faith ... and the love?

Does love... light up your Christmas tree?

I'm feeling sea sick again
The whole world could just dissolve
Into a glass of water
I've been good 'cause I know you don't want me to
Do you really want me to be blue as you
It's her daylight that gets me through
We've been here before
Last time you scratched at my door
The moon was naked and cold
I was like a two year old
Who just wanted more
If you wear that velvet dress
If you wear that velvet dress
Tonight the moon has drawn its curtains
It's a private show
No one else going to know
I'm wanting
Sunlight, sunlight fills my room
It's sharp and it's clear
But nothing at all like the moon
It's okay, the struggle for things not to say
I never listened to you anyway
And I got my own hands to pray
But if you wear that velvet dress
But if you wear that velvet dress
Tonight the moon is a mirrorball
Light flickers from across the hall
Who'll catch the star when it falls
If you wear that velvet dress"

WiIl you be there
In a little while
I will blow by every breeze
Friday night running
To Sunday on my knees
That girl, that girl
She's mine
And I've know her since
Since you were a little girl
With Spanish eyes
Oh, when I saw her
In a pram they pushed her by
My, how you've grown
Well it's been
It's been a little while
Slow down my bleeding heart
Man dreams one day to fly
A man takes a rocketship into the skys
He lives on starlets dying in the night
And follows in the trail
The scatter of light
Turn it on
Turn it on
You turn me on
Slow down my bleeding heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my bleeding heart
Slowly, slowly love
Slow down my beating heart
Slowly, slowly love"

Desert sky
Dream beneath a desert sky
The rivers run but soon run dry
We need new dreams tonight
Desert rose
Dreamed I saw a desert rose
Dress torn in ribbons and in bows
Like a siren she calls to me
Sleep comes like a drug
In God's Country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses
In God's Country
Set me alight
We'll punch a hole right through the night
Everyday the dreamers die
To see what's on the other side
She is liberty
And she comes to rescue me
Hope, faith, her vanity
The greatest gift is gold
Sleep comes like a drug
In God's Country
Sad eyes, crooked crosses
In God's Country
Naked flame
She stands with a naked flame
I stand with the sons of Cain
Burned by the fire of love
Burned by the fire of love"

Like there, I don't know why
In the forest, there's a clearing
I run there towards the light
Sky...
It's a blue sky
In the earth a hole dig deep, decide
If I could, I would
Up for air to swim against the tide
Hey, hey, hey
Up toward the sky
It's a blue sky
To lose along the way
The spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade
On this the longest day
So wind blow through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind blow through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind blow through to my heart...
You give yourself to this the longest day
You give yourself, you give it all away
Two rivers run too deep
The seasons change and so do I
The light that strikes the tallest trees
Will light a way for I
Will light a way
Up toward the sky
It's a blue sky
To lose along the way
The spark that set the flame
To flicker and to fade
On this the longest day
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart
So wind blow through my soul
So wind go through to my heart...

Kite	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/kite-lyrics-18566.html	All That You Can't Leave Behind	"Something
Is about to give
I can feel it coming
I think I know what it is
I'm not afraid to die
I'm not afraid to live
And when I'm flat on my back
I hope to feel like I did
And hardness
It sets in
You need some protection
The thinner the skin
I want you to know
That you don't need me anymore
I want you to know
You don't need anyone
Or anything at all
Who's to say where the wind will take you
Who's to say what it is will break you
I don't know
Which way the wind will blow
Who's to know when the time has come around
Don't want to see you cry
I know that this is not goodbye
It's somewhere I can taste the salty sea
There's a kite blowing out of control on the breeze
I wonder what's gonna happen to you
You wonder what has happened to me
I'm a man
I'm not a child
A man who sees
The shadow behind your eyes
Who's to say where the wind will take you
Who's to say what it is will break you
I don't know
Where the wind will blow
Who's to know when the time has come around
I don't want to see you cry
I know that this is not goodbye
Did I waste it
Not so much I couldn't taste it
Life should be fragrant
Rooftop to the basement
The last of the rocks stars
When hip-hop drove the big cars
In the time when new media
Was the big idea
What was the big idea"

The world turns and we get dizzy
(Minute hands and second sticking... )
Slipping away
(There's something going on she might be missing
the world turns and we get dizzy
Is it spinning for you the way it's spinning for me)
She's living living next week now
You know she's going to pay it back somehow
The future is here at last
The past is too uncomfortable

Lemon	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/lemon-lyrics-18523.html	Zooropa	"Lemon, see through in the sunlight
She wore lemon but never in the daylight
She's gonna make you cry
She's gonna make you whisper and moan
When you're dry she draws her water from the stone
And I feel like I'm slowly, slowly, slowly slipping under
And I feel like I'm holding onto nothing
She wore lemon to colour in the cold, grey night
She had heaven and she held on so tight
A man makes a picture, a moving picture
Through light projected he can see himself up close
A man captures colour, a man likes to stare
He turns his money into light to look for her
And I feel like I'm drifting, drifting, drifting from the shore
And I feel like I'm swimming out to her
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Alright, alright, alright, alright
A man builds a city with banks and cathedrals
A man melts the sands so he can see the world outside
You're gonna meet her there
A man makes a car
She's your destination
And builds a road to run them on
You gotta get to her
A man dreams of leaving
She's imagination
But he always stays behind
And these are the days when our work has come asunder
And these are the days when we look for something other
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
Midnight is where the day begins
And these are the days when our work has come asunder

Like A Song	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/like_a_song-lyrics-18466.html	War	"Like a song I have to sing
I sing it for you
Like the words I have to bring
I bring it for you
And in leather, lace, and chains
We stake our claim
Revolution once again
No I won't...
I won't wear it on my sleeve
I can see through this expression
And you know I don't believe
Too young to be told
Exactly who are you
Tonight
Tomorrow's
Too late
And we love to wear a badge, a uniform
And we love to fly a flag
But I won't...let others live in hell
As we divide against each other
And we fight amongst ourselves
Too set in our ways to try to rearrange
Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song
Let the bells ring out
Let the bells ring out
Is there nothing left
Is there, is there nothing
Is there nothing left
Is honesty what you want
A generation without name, ripped and torn
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain
Nothing at all
And if you can't help yourself
Well take a look around you
When others need your time
You say it's time to go...it's your time
Angry words won't stop the fight
Two wrongs won't make it right
A new heart is what I need
Oh God, make it bleed
Is there nothing left..."

Lay down
Lay your sweet lovely on the ground
Lay your love on the track
We're gonna break the monster's back
Yes we are...
Lay down your treasure
Lay it down now brother
You don't have time
For a jealous lover
As you enter this life
I pray you depart
With a wrinkled face
And a brand new heart
I don't know if I can take it
I'm not easy on my knees
Here's my heart you can break it
I need some release, release, release
We need
Love and peace
Love and peace
Lay down
Lay down your guns
All your daughters of Zion
All your Abraham sons
I don't know if I can make it
I'm not easy on my knees
Here's my heart and you can break it
I need some release, release, release
We need
Love and peace
Love and peace
Baby don't fight
We can talk this thing through
It's not a big problem
It's just me and you
You can call or I'll phone
The TV is still on
But the sound is turned down
And the troops on the ground
Are about to dig in
And I wonder where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Where is the love?
Love and peace"

Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh my heart
Love is blindness
In a parked car
In a crowded street
You see your love
Made complete
Thread is ripping
The knot is slipping
Love is blindness
Love is clockworks
And cold steel
Fingers too numb to feel
Squeeze the handle
Blow out the candle
Love is blindness
Love is blindness
I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh my love
Blindness
A little death
Without mourning
No call
And no warning
Baby...a dangerous idea
That almost makes sense
Love is drowning
In a deep well
All the secrets
And no one to tell
Take the money
Honey
Blindness
Love is blindness
I don't want to see
Won't you wrap the night
Around me
Oh my love
Blindness"

On the road to my regret
Many lost who seek to find themselves in me

The very thoughts they would conceal

Makes a shadow of you and I
Stretching out as the sun sinks in the sea

In the palace of my shame

I see my reflection pass
See the dark shades of what I used to be
See the purple of her eyes
The scarlet of my lies

Yea, though I walk
In the valley of shadow
Yea, I will fear no evil
I have cursed thy rod and staff
They no longer comfort me

I'm on the eve of a storm
And my word you must believe in
Oh, I said love, rescue me
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah...
Yeah I'm here without a name
In the palace of my shame
I said love rescue me

The future is here at last
I stand at the entrance
To a new world I can see
The ruins to the right of me
Will soon have lost sight of me

Miami	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/miami-lyrics-18542.html	Pop	"Weather 'round here choppin' and changin'
Surgery in the air
Print shirts and southern accents
Cigars and big hair
We got the wheels and petrol is cheap
Only went there for a week
Got the sun got the sand
Got the batteries in the handycam...
Her eyes all swimming pool blue
Dumb bells on a diving board
Baby's always attracted to the things she's afraid of
Big girl with the sweet tooth
Watches the skinny girl in the photo shoot
Freshmen squeaky clean
She tastes of chlorine
MIAMI MY MAMMY
Love the movies... love to walk those movie sets
Get to shoot someone in the foot
Get to smoke some cigarettes
No big deal we know the score
Just back from the video store
Got the car and the car chase
What's he got inside the case
I want a close up of that face
Here comes the car chase
MIAMI MY MAMMY
MIAMI
I bought two new suits... miami
PINK AND BLUE.. MIAMI
I took a picture of you... miami
Getting hot in a photo booth... miami
I said you looked like a madonna
You said... maybe... said I want to have your baby... BABY
WE COULD MAKE something beautiful
Something that wouldn't be a problem
At least not in... miami
Some places are like your auntie
But there's no place like

Freedom has a scent
Like the top of a new born baby's head

I see them when you smile
I've had enough I'm not giving up
On a miracle drug
Of science and the human heart
There is no limit
There is no failure here sweetheart
Just when you quit...
I am you and you are mine
Love makes nonsense of space
And time...will disappear
Love and logic keep us clear
Reason is on our side, love...
The songs are in your eyes
I see them when you smile
I've had enough of romantic love
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up
For a miracle, a miracle drug, a miracle drug
God I need your help tonight
Beneath the noise
Below the din
I hear a voice
It's whispering
In science and in medicine
""I was a stranger
You took me in""

lookin' for baby Jesus under the trash

mother am i still your son, you know i've waited for so long to hear you say so
mother you left and made me someone
now i'm still a child but no one tells me no
lookin' for a sound that's gonna drown out the world
lookin' for the father of my two little girls
got the swing got the sway got my straw in lemonade
still looking for the face I had before the world was made

Were cut down and taken from us
Hear their heartbeat
We hear their heartbeat
In the wind we hear their laughter
In the rain we see their tears
Hear their heartbeat

Night hangs like a prisoner
Stretched over black and blue
Hear their heartbeat
We hear their heartbeat
In the trees our sons stand naked
Through the walls our daughters cry
See their tears in the rainfall"

Never Let Me Go	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/never_let_me_go-lyrics-1119790.html	Soundtrack - The Million Dollar Hotel	"Wow, after I jumped, it occured to me: life is perfect. Life is the best, full of magic and beauty, opportunity and television, and surprises, lots of surprises, yeah.
And then there's the best stuff, of course, better than anything anyone ever made up 'cause it's real.
You take a stranger by the hand
A man who doesn't understand his wildest dreams
You walk across the dirty sand
And offer him an ocean of what he's never seen
Maybe I was blind
Or I might have closed my eyes
Maybe I was dumb
But what forgot to say
If you didn't know
Is never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go
You run from love and don't believe
Unless it catches you by the heel
And even then, you struggle
From red island across the strand
Your footprints still there in the sand
Everything else washed away
I may not be alone
Or I may have found my home
I may have lost my way
But what I forgot to say
If you didn't know
Is never let me go
Never let me go
Never let me go"

And I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's Day
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
Under a blood-red sky
A crowd has gathered in black and white
Arms entwined, the chosen few,
The newspapers say, say, say it's true
And we can break through,
Though torn in two, we can be one
I will begin again, I will begin again
Oh and maybe the time is right
Oh maybe tonight
I will be with you again
I will be with you again
And so we are told this is the golden age
And gold is the reason for the wars we wage
Though I want to be with you
Be with you night and day
Nothing changes on New Year's day"

In New York I found a friend
To drown out the other voices
Voices on a cell phone
Voices from home
Voices through the hard sell
Voices down a stairwell
In New York
Just got a place in New York
In New York summers get hot
Well into the hundreds
You can walk around the block
Without a change of clothing
Hot as a hair dryer in your face
Hot as handbag and a can of mace

Forget how to sit still
Tell yourself you will stay in

Feel like they own the place
They got the airport, city hall
The asphalt dance floor (??)
They even got the police

Religious nuts, political fanatics in the stew
Happily not like me and you
That's where I lost you

New York, New York

In New York I lost it all
To you and your vices
Still I'm staying on to figure out
Midlife crisis
I hit an iceberg in my life
You know I'm still afloat
You lose your balance, lose your wife
In the queue for the lifeboat
You better put the women and children first
But you've got an unquenchable thirst for New York

New York, New York
In the stillness of the evening
When the sun has had its day
I heard your voice whispering
Come away now

Burning inside of me

One	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/one-lyrics-18510.html	Achtung Baby	"Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same
Will it make it easier on you
Now you got someone to blame
You say one love, one life
When it's one need in the night
It's one love
We get to share it
It leaves you baby
If you don't care for it
Did I disappoint you
Or leave a bad taste in your mouth
You act like you never had love
And you want me to go without
Well it's too late tonight
To drag the past out into the light
We're one but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other
One
Have you come here for forgiveness
Have you come to raise the dead
Have you come here to play Jesus
To the lepers in your head
Did I ask too much
More than a lot
You gave me nothing
Now it's all I got
We're one but we're not the same
We hurt each other, then we do it again
You say love is a temple
Love a higher law
Love is a temple
Love the higher law
You ask me to enter but then you make me crawl
And I can't be holding on to what you got
When all you got is hurt
One love, one blood, one life
You got to do what you should
One life with each other
Sisters, brothers
One life but we're not the same
We get to carry each other, carry each other

One Step Closer	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/one_step_closer-lyrics-219139.html	How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb	"I'm 'round the corner from anything that's real
I'm across the road from hope
I'm under a bridge in a rip tide
That's taken everything I call my own
One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
I'm on an island at a busy intersection
I can't go forward, I can't turn back
Can't see the future
It's getting away from me
I just watch the tail lights glowing
One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
Knowing, knowing
I'm hanging out to dry
With my old clothes
Finger still red with the prick of an old rose
Well the heart that hurts
Is a heart that beats
Can you hear the drummer slowing?
One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
One step closer to knowing
To knowing, to knowing, to knowing"
One Tree Hill	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/one_tree_hill-lyrics-18490.html	The Joshua Tree	"We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill
As the day begs the night for mercy
Your sun so bright it leaves no shadows, only scars
Carved into stone on the face of earth
The moon is up over One Tree Hill
We see the sun go down in your eyes
You ran like a river oh, to the sea
You run like a river runs to the sea
And in our world a heart of darkness
A firezone where poets speak their hearts
Then bleed for it
Jara sang his song a weapon
In the hands of love
You know his blood still cries from the ground
It runs like a river, runs to the sea
It runs like a river to the sea
I don't believe in painted roses or bleeding hearts
While bullets rape the night of the merciful
I'll see you again when the stars fall from the sky
And the moon has turned red over One Tree Hill
We run like a river to the sea, run to the sea
We run like a river to the sea
And when it's raining, raining hard
That's when the rain will break my heart
Raining, raining hard, raining in your heart
Raining, rain into your heart, raining
Oh great ocean, oh great sea
Run to the ocean, run to the sea"

The end is not as fun as the start
Please stay a child somewhere in your heart
I'll give you everything you want
Except the thing that you want
You are the first one of your kind
And you feel like no-one before
You steal right under my door
And I kneel 'cause I want you some more
I want the lot of what you got
And I want nothing that you're not
Everywhere you go you shout it
You don't have to be shy about it
Some things you shouldn't get too good at
Like smiling, crying and celebrity
Some people got way too much confidence baby
I'll give you everything you want

You don't have to be shy about it, no
And you'll never be alone
Come on now show your soul
You've been keeping your love under control
Everywhere you go you shout it
You don't have to be shy about it

Eighteen years of dawning
I say how long
You say how long
It was one dull morning
Woke the world with bawling
I was so sad (so sad)
It was so bad
I was of a feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control
Boys and Girls
Go to the school and girls
They make children
Not like this one
I was of a feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control
I was of a feeling it was out of control
I had the opinion it was out of control

There's blood on the garden gate

It's in his childhood

Will it be too late
You can't fight it

Paint It Black	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/paint_it_black-lyrics-18586.html	All That You Can't Leave Behind	"I see a red door
And I want it painted black
No colors anymore
I want them to turn black
I see the girls walk by
Dressed in their summer clothes
I have to turn my head
Until my darkness goes
I see a line of cars
And they're all painted black
With flowers and my love
Both never to come back
I see them turn their heads
Quickly look away
Like a newborn baby
It just happens every day
I look inside my self
See my heart is back
I see my red door
And I want it painted black
Maybe then I'll fade away
And not have to face the facts
It's not easy facing up
When your whole world is black
No more will my green sea
Go turn a deeper blue
I could not foresee
This thing happening to you.
If I look hard enough
Into the setting sun,
My love will laugh with me
Before the morning comes

Wham Bam
And she won't tell me his name

I was wrong
And so I sing along
And if you dance, then dance with me

Peace On Earth	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/peace_on_earth-lyrics-18565.html	All That You Can't Leave Behind	"Heaven on Earth
We need it now
I'm sick of all of this
Hanging around
Sick of sorrow
I'm sick of the pain
I'm sick of hearing
Again and again
That there's gonna be
Peace on Earth
Where I grew up
There weren't many trees
Where there was we'd tear them down
And use them on our enemies
They say that what you mock
Will surely overtake you
And you become a monster
So the monster will not break you
And it's already gone too far
You said that if you go in hard
You won't get hurt
Jesus can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth
Tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
No who's or why's
No one cries like a mother cries
For peace on Earth
She never got to say goodbye
To see the color in his eyes
Now he's in the dirt
Peace on Earth
They're reading names out
Over the radio
All the folks the rest of us
Won't get to know
Sean and Julia
Gareth, Anne, and Breeda
Their lives are bigger than
Any big idea
Jesus can you take the time
To throw a drowning man a line
Peace on Earth
To tell the ones who hear no sound
Whose sons are living in the ground
Peace on Earth
Jesus in the song you wrote
The words are sticking in my throat
Peace on Earth
Hear it every Christmas time
But hope and history won't rhyme
So what's it worth
This peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth
Peace on Earth"
Playboy Mansion	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/playboy_mansion-lyrics-18543.html	Pop	"If Coke is a mystery, Michael Jackson History
If beauty is truth, and surgery the fountain of youth
What am I to do?
Have I got the gift to get me through
The gates of that Mansion
If OJ is more than a drink, a Big Mac bigger than you think
If perfume is an Obsession, then talk shows confession
What have we got to lose?
I'll never push my way through
The gates of that mansion
I never bought a Lotto ticket
I never parked in anyone's space
And the banks feel like cathedrals because casinos took their place
Luck, come on down
I wake up, she'll come around
Sex is a kind of religion
We're down for playin' hard luck
I never did see that movie, and I never did read that book
Luck, come on down, let my numbers come around
Don't know if I can hold on
Don't know if I'm that strong
Don't know if I can wait that long
Til the colors come flashing and the lights go on
Then will there be no time for sorrow
Then will there be no time for shame
And though I can't say why
I know I've got to believe
We'll go diving in their pool
It's who you know that gets you through
The gates in the Playboy Mansion
The Playboy Mansion
In the Playboy Mansion
Then will there be no time for sorrow?
Then will there be no time for shame?"

Your family tree
And all your lessons in history

And you never knew what was on the ground till they made you crawl

Your holy war
Your northern star
Your sermon on the mount
From the boot of your car

spilling over down the drain

November... December... remember...

One come here to justify,
One man to overthrow,

What more in the name of love.
One man crawled on a barb wire fence,
One man he resist.
One man washed on an empty beach.
One man betrayed with a kiss.
In the name of love,
What more in the name of love.

A shot rings out in the Memphis sky.
Free at last, they took your life,
But they could not take your pride.

In a spiral staircase

And I, like a firework, explode
Roman candle lightning lights up the sky
In the cracked streets trampled under foot
Sidestep, sidewalk
I see you stare into space
Have I got closer now
Behind the face
Oh...tell me...
Charity dance with me
Turn me around tonight
Up through spiral staircase
To the higher ground

Injured in doubt

Set fire to the sky

The chain undone

As you jump to the street below
But where can you go
To leave yourself behind
Alone in the spotlight
Of this, your own tragedy
I give you my love, love, love

Maybe run from the darkness in the night

Ha la la la de day ha la la de day
Sweet the sin, bitter the taste in my mouth
I see seven towers but I only see one way out
You got to cry with out weeping, talk without speaking
Scream without raising your voice
You know I took the poison from the poison stream
Then I floated out of here
Singing ha la la la de day
Ha la la la de day ha la la de day
She runs through the streets with her eyes painted red
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain
In through a doorway she brings me
White gold and pearls stolen from the sea
She is raging, she is raging
And the storm blows up in her eyes
She will suffer the needle chill
She is running to stand still"

Baby don't sing yet
I got to get you
Got to, got to get you
Won't you dance for me
I got to get you
Got to, got to get you
Beneath the cherry tree
I got to get you
Got to, got to get you
Won't you swing down low
I got to get you
Got to, got to get you
I got to get you
Got to, got to get you
Please

Got to, got to get you
Baby please say yes
I got to get you
Got to, got to get you
Baby don't go away
I got to get you
Got to, got to get you
Don't spill any of your precious love
I got to get you
Got to, got to get you
Shake it, shake it, shake it Salome
Shake it, shake it, shake it Salome
Shake it, shake it, shake it Salome
Shake it, shake it, shake it Salome

Satellite Of Love	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/satellite_of_love-lyrics-18584.html	All That You Can't Leave Behind	"Satellite's gone up to the sky
Things like that drive me out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite
Satellite's gone, way up to Mars
Soon it will be filled with parking cars
I watched it for a little while
I like to watch things on TV
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite of love
Satellite
I've been told that you've been bold
With Harry, Mark and John
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday,
Harry, Mark and John
Satellite's gone up to the sky
Things like that drive me out of my mind
I watched it for a little while
I love to watch things on TV

Seconds	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/seconds-lyrics-18464.html	War	"Takes a second to say goodbye
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh
It takes a second to say goodbye
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh, say bye bye...
Where you going to now...
Lightning flashes across the sky
East to west, do or die
Like a thief in the night
See the world by candlelight.
Fall, rise and...Fall, rise and...
In an apartment on Time Square
You can assemble them anywhere
Held to ransom, hell to pay
A revolution everyday
USSR, GDR, London, New York, Peking
It's the puppets, It's the puppets
Who pull the strings
Fall, rise and...Fall, rise and...
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye
It takes a second to say goodbye
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh
Push the button and pull the plug
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh
Fall, rise and...Fall, rise and...
And they're doing the atomic bomb
Do they know where the dance comes from
Yes they're doing the atomic bomb
They want you to sing along
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Say goodbye
Say goodbye."
Shadows And Tall Trees	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/shadows_and_tall_trees-lyrics-18452.html	Boy	"Back to the cold restless streets at night
I talk to myself about tomorrow night
Walls of white protest
A gravestone in name
Who is it now
It's always the same
Who is it now
Who calls me inside
Are the leaves on the trees
Just living disguise
I walk sweet rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again
to the street melody
But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know...
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Shadows and tall trees
Life through a window
Discoloured pain
Mrs. Brown's washing is always the same
I walk street rain tragicomedy
I'll walk home again
to the street melody
But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know...
(Out there)
Do you feel in me...
Anything redeeming
Any worthwhile feeling
Is love like a tightrope
Hanging from the ceiling
But I know, oh no
But I know, oh no
But I know...
Shadows and Tall Trees..."
Silver And Gold	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/silver_and_gold-lyrics-18558.html	The Best Of 1980-1990 (Disk 2)	"In the shithouse a shotgun
Praying hands hold me down
Only the hunter was hunted
In this tin can town
Tin can town
No stars in the black night
Looks like the sky fall down
No sun in the daylight
Looks like it's chained to the ground
Chained to the ground
The warden says the exit is sold
If you want a way out
Silver and gold
Silver and gold
Broken back to the ceiling
Broken nose to the floor
I scream at the silence, it's crawling
It crawls under the door
There's a rope around my neck
And there's, there's a trigger in your gun
Jesus say something
I am someone, I am someone
Captains and kings in the ships hold
They came to collect
Silver and gold
Silver and gold
See the coming and the going
See the captains and the kings
See them navy blue uniforms
See them bright and shiny things
Bright, shiny things, yeah
The temperature is rising
The fever white hot
Mister, I ain't got nothing
But it's more than you got
Chains no longer bind me
Not the shackles at my feet
Outside are the prisoners
Inside the free
Set them free
Set them free
A prize fighter in a corner is told
Hit where it hurts
Silver and gold
Silver and gold"
Slow Dancing	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/slow_dancing-lyrics-18589.html	All That You Can't Leave Behind	"My love is cruel as the night
She steals the sun, and shuts out the light
All of my colors, they turn to blue
Win or lose
She does it slow dancing
Slow dancing
She does it slow...dancing
All night long
Scarlet eyes and a see-through heart
She saw me coming right from the start
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees
Just a' beggin' her, beggin' her please
Take me slow dancing
Slow dancing
She took me slow...dancing
All night long
And I don't know a man
Search for himself in his lover's eyes
No I don't know why a man
Sees the truth but needs the lies
My love is restless as the wind
She moves like a shadow across my skin
She left with my conscience, I don't want it back
It just gets in the way
If you wanna go slow dancing
Slow dancing
She took me slow...dancing
All night long
Slow...dancing
Slow...dancing
Slow..."

Win or lose
She does it slow dancing
Slow dancing

Scarlet eyes and a see-through heart
I saw I coming right from the start
She picked me up, but had me down on my knees
Just a-begging her please
Take me slow dancing
Slow dancing
Slow dancing
Well I don't know why a man
Search for himself in his woman's eyes
No, I don't know why a man
Sees the truth but needs the lies
My love is restless as the wind
She moves like a shadow across my skin
She left with my conscience
I don't want it back

Slug	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/slug-lyrics-18530.html	Passengers: Original Soundtrack	"Don't want to lose my shirt
Don't want to dig the dirt
Don't want you to get hurt
Can't help but I'm a flirt
Don't want to take your drugs
Don't want to be a slug
Don't want to overdress
Don't want to make a mess
Don't want you to confess
Not under duress
Don't want be untrue
I want to be with you
Don't want to lose my nerve
Don't want to throw the curve
Don't want to make you swerve
Don't want what I deserve

So Cruel	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/so_cruel-lyrics-18513.html	Achtung Baby	"We crossed the line
Who pushed who over
It doesn't matter to you
It matters to me
We're cut adrift
But still floating
I'm only hanging on
To watch you go down
My love
I disappeared in you
You disappeared from me
I gave you everything you ever wanted
It wasn't what you wanted
The men who love you, you hate the most
They pass right through you like a ghost
They look for you but your spirit is in the air
Baby, you're nowhere
Oh...love...you say in love there are no rules
Oh...love...sweetheart...
You're so cruel
Desperation is a tender trap
It gets you every time
You put your lips to her lips
To stop the lie
Her skin is pale like God's only dove
Screams like an angel for your love
Then she makes you watch her from above
And you need her like a drug
Oh...love...you say in love there are no rules
Oh...love...sweetheart...
You're so cruel
She wears my love like a see-through dress
Her lips say one thing
Her movements something else
Oh love...like a screaming flower
Love...dying every hour...love
You don't know if it's fear or desire
Danger the drug that takes you higher
Head in heaven, fingers in the mire
Her heart is racing, you can't keep up
The night is bleeding like a cut
Between the horses of love and lust
We are trampled underfoot
Oh...love...you say in love there are no rules
Oh...love...sweetheart...
You're so cruel
Oh...love...to stay with you I'd be a fool
Sweetheart...you're so cruel"
Some Days Are Better Than Others	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/some_days_are_better_than_others-lyrics-18526.html	Zooropa	"Some days are dry, some days are leaky
Some days come clean, other days are sneaky
Some days take less, but most days take more
Some slip through your fingers and onto the floor
Some days you're quick, but most days you're speedy
Some days you use more force than is necessary
Some days just drop in on us
Some days are better than others
Some days it all adds up
And what you got is not enough
Some days are better than others
Some days are slippy, other days sloppy
Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy
Your skin is white but you think you're a brother
Some days are better than others
Some days you wake up with her complaining
Some sunny days you wish it was raining
Some days are sulky, some days have a grin
And some days have bouncers and won't let you in
Some days you hear a voice
Taking you to another place
Some days are better than others
Some days are honest, some days are not
Some days you're thankful for what you've got
Some days you wake up in the army
And some days it's the enemy
Some days are work, most days you're lazy
Some days you feel like a bit of a baby
Lookin' for Jesus and His mother
Some days are better than others
Some days you feel ahead
You're making sense of what she said
Some days are better than others
Some days you hear a voice
Taking you to another place
Some days are better than others"
Sometimes You Can’t Make It On Your Own	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/sometimes_you_cant_make_it_on_your_own-lyrics-219133.html	How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb	"Tough, you think you’ve got the stuff
You’re telling me and anyone
You’re hard enough
You don’t have to put up a fight
You don’t have to always be right
Let me take some of the punches
For you tonight
Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don’t have to go it alone
And it’s you when I look in the mirror
And it’s you when I don’t pick up the phone
Sometimes you can’t make it on your own
We fight all the time
You and I… that’s alright
We’re the same soul
I don’t need… I don’t need to hear you say
That if we weren’t so alike
You’d like me a whole lot more
Listen to me now
I need to let you know
You don’t have to go it alone
And it’s you when I look in the mirror
And it’s you when I don’t pick up the phone
Sometimes you can’t make it on your own
I know that we don’t talk
I’m sick of it all
Can - you - hear - me – when – I -
Sing, you’re the reason I sing
You’re the reason why the opera is in me…
Where are we now?
I’ve got to let you know
A house still doesn’t make a home
Don’t leave me here alone...
And it’s you when I look in the mirror
And it’s you that makes it hard to let go
Sometimes you can’t make it on your own
Sometimes you can’t make it
The best you can do is to fake it
Sometimes you can’t make it on your own"

Wey hey hey, baby hang on
Empty heart, beat tight as a drum
Said empty love, she'd shine like a song
Wey hey hey, baby hang on (to anything)
Our love shines like rain
In those spanish eyes
Spanish eyes
Wey hey hey, here she comes
She comes in colors
You know she gonna turn the daylight on
'cause I love the way you talk to me
And I love the way you walk on me
And I need you more
Oh, than you need me
Our love shines like rain
In those spanish eyes
Spanish eyes
I'll cross the world for green and gold
But it's those Spanish eyes
That get me home...home again
Wey hey hey, baby hang on
Wey hey hey, you know that
The night is young
Dazzled by lights that shine in your eyes
I'm standing in the shadows
And wait for the night
Forever in fever, forever in heat
You pick me up to put me out on the street
Wey hey hey, baby hang on, hang on
Wey hey hey, baby hang on, hang on
'cause I love the way you talk to me
And I love the way you're mean to me
And I need you"
Staring At The Sun	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/staring_at_the_sun-lyrics-18539.html	Pop	"Summer stretching on the grass... summer dresses pass
In the shade of a willow tree creeps a crawling over me
Over me and over you stuck together with God's glue
It's going to get stickier too...
It's been a long hot summer
let's go undercover
Don't try too hard to think... don't think at all
I'm not the only one starin' at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find if you took a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb i'm staring at the sun
Not the only one who's happy to go blind
There's an insect in your ear if you scratch it won't disappear
It's gonna itch and burn and sting
Do you want to see what the scratching brings
Waves that leave me out of reach
Breaking on your back like a beach...
Will we ever live in peace?
Cause those that can't do often have to
Those that can't do often have to... preach
To the ones staring at the sun...
Afraid of what you'll find if you took a look inside
Not just deaf and dumb... staring at the sun
I'm not the only one who'd rather go blind
Intransigence is all around... military is still in town
Armour plated suits and ties... daddy just won't say goodbye
Referee won't blow the whistle God is good but will HE listen
I'm nearly great
But there's something I'm missing I left in the duty free
Though you never really belonged to me
You're not the only one staring at the sun
Afraid of what you'd find if you stepped back inside
I'm not sucking my thumb I'm staring at the sun
Not the only one who's happy to go blind"

Weightless
Stateless
Such a girl
There are no colors in your eye
There's no sunshine in your sky
There's no race, only the prize
There is no tomorrow, only tonight
Stateless
It's the difference
You can cover a world with your thumb
Still so big, so bright, so beautiful
Weightless
Stateless
Push down on me
Push down on me
A weight now
A weight down on me
Your weight down
Be the weight, hard
Down on me
Be the heavy hand
The wall of sand
Be the weight, hard
Down on me

You stop in for a pack of cigarettes
You don't smoke, don't even want to
Hey now, check your change
Dressed up like a car crash
The wheels are turning but you're upside down
You say when he hits you you don't mind
Because when he hurts you you feel alive
Oh now, is that what it is
Red light, grey morning
You stumble out of a hole in the ground
A vampire or a victim
It depends on who's around
You used to stay in to watch the adverts
You could lip-synch to the talk shows
And if you look, you look through me
And if you talk, you talk at me
And if I touch you, you don't feel a thing
If I could stay, then the night would give you up
Stay and the day would keep its trust
Stay and the night would be enough
Faraway, so close up with the static and the radio
With satellite television you can go anywhere
Miami, New Orleans, London, Belfast, and Berlin
And if you listen, I can't call
And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout, I'll only hear you
But if you stay then the night would break its trust
Stay and the day would give you
Stay with the spirit you found
Stay and the night will be enough
And if you listen, I can't call
And if you jump, you just might fall
And if you shout, I'll only hear you
But if you stay then the day would give you up
Stay with the demons you drowned
Stay with the spirit you found
Stay and the night will be enough
Three o'clock in the morning
It's quiet and there's no one around
Just the bang and the clatter as an angel runs to ground
Just the bang and the clatter as an angel hits the ground"

Stranger In A Strange Land	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/stranger_in_a_strange_land-lyrics-18461.html	October	"Stranger
Stranger in a strange land
He looked at me like I
Was the one who should run
We asked him to smile for a photograph
Waited a while to see if we could
Make him laugh
A soldier asked for a cigarette
His smiling face I can't forget
He looked like you across the street
But that's a long way here
And I wish you were here
And I wish you were here
Stranger
A stranger in a strange land
He look at me like I
Was the one who should run
I watched as he watched us
Get back on the bus
I watched the way it was
The way it was when he was with us
And I really don't mind
Sleeping on the floor
But I couldn't sleep after what I saw
I wrote this letter to tell you
The way I feel
I wish you were here
I wish you were here
To see what I could see
To hear
And I wish you were here"

Of anything in this world
There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find
A decent melody
A song that I can sing
In my own company
I never thought you were a fool
But darling look at you
You gotta stand up straight
Carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere baby
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And now you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
I will not forsake
The colors that you bring
The nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted
By the light you brought to me
I listen through your ears
Through your eyes I can see
And you are such a fool
To worry like you do
I know it's tough
And you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now
My, oh my
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Oh love, look at you now
You've got yourself stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
I was unconscious, half asleep
The water is warm 'til you discover how deep
I wasn't jumping, for me it was a fall
It's a long way down to nothing at all
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment
And you can't get out of it
And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if our way should falter
Along the stony pass
And if the night runs over
And if the day won't last
And if your way should falter
Along this stony pass
It's just a moment
This time will pass"

There's nothing you can throw at me
That I haven't already heard
I'm just trying to find a decent melody
A song that I can sing in my own company
I never thought you were a fool
But darling, look at you
You gotta stand up straight, carry your own weight
These tears are going nowhere, baby
You've got to get yourself together
You've got stuck in a moment and you can't get out of
Don't say that later will be better
Now you're stuck in a moment and you can't get out of it
I will not forsake the colours that you bring
But the nights you filled with fireworks
They left you with nothing
I am still enchanted by the light you brought to me
I still listen through your ears
And through your eyes I can see
And you are such a fool to worry like you do
I know it's tough and you can never get enough
Of what you don't really need now, my oh my
You've got to get yourself together

Summer Rain	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/summer_rain-lyrics-1119822.html	7	"When you stop seeing beauty you start growing old
The lines on your face are a map to your soul
When you stop taking chances
you'll stay where you sit
You won't live any longer but it'll feel like it
I lost myself in the summer rain
I lost myself
I lost myself in the summer rain
In the summer rain
Tequila and orange, Jamaica and rum
At the Morella, honey on my tongue
In a small boat on a generous sea
You let me be your enemy
Tiny hand with a grip on the world
Holding our breath now, diving for pearls
I lost myself in the summer rain
I lost myself
I lost myself in the summer rain
Just as you find me always I will be
A little bit too free with myself
Just as you find me always I will be
A little bit too free with myself
I lost myself in the summer rain
I lost myself
Now there's no one else in the summer rain
Raining down
Raining down
Rain
Raining down
Raining down
Just as you find me always I will be
A little bit too free with myself
Just as you find me always I will be
A little bit too free with myself
It's not why you're running
It's where you're going
It's not what you're dreaming
But what you're gonna do
It's not where you're born
It's where you belong
It's not how weak
But what will make you strong"

How long, how long
Tonight we can be as one, tonight
Broken bottles under children's feet
Bodies strewn across a dead end street
But I won't heed the battle call
It puts my back up
Puts my back up against the wall
Sunday bloody Sunday
Sunday bloody Sunday
And the battle's just begun
There's many lost, but tell me who has won
Trenches dug within our hearts
And mothers, children, brothers, sisters torn apart

How long, how long must we sing this song
How long, how long
'Cause tonight we can be as one
Tonight, tonight
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Tonight, tonight

Wipe the tears from your eyes
Wipe your tears away
I wipe your tears away
I wipe your tears away
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Wipe your blood shot eyes
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
Sunday, bloody Sunday
And it's true we are immune
When fact is fiction and T.V. reality
Sunday, bloody Sunday
And today the millions cry
Sunday, bloody Sunday
We eat and drink while tomorrow they die
Sunday, bloody Sunday
The real battle just begun
Sunday, bloody Sunday
To claim the victory Jesus won
On a Sunday, bloody Sunday

Sadie said she couldn't work out
What it was all about
And so she let go
Now Sadie's on the street
And the people she meets you know
She tried to be a good girl and a good wife
Raise a good family
Lead a good life
It's not good enough
She got herself up on the 48th floor
Gotta find out
Find out what she's living for
Surrender, Surrender
Surrender, Surrender
Tonight...
Oh, the city's afire
A passionate flame
It knows me by name
Oh, the city's desire
To take me for more and more
It's in the street, getting under my feet
It's in the air, it's everywhere
My love for you
It's in the things I do and say
If I wanna live I gotta
Die to myself someday

Papa sing my sing my sing my song..."

Shows me colours when there's none to see
Gives me hope when I can't believe
But for the first time I feel love
I have a brother when I'm a brother in need
I spend my whole time running
He spends his running after me
I feel myself goin' down
I just call and he comes around
But for the first time I feel love
My father is a rich man, he wears a rich man's cloak
Gave me the keys to his kingdom coming
Gave me a cup of gold
He said 'I have many mansions
And there are many rooms to see'
But I left by the back door
And I threw away the key
And I threw away the key
Yeah, I threw away the key
Yeah, I threw away the key
For the first time
For the first time
For the first time I feel love"

It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon
You know I don't see you when she walks in the room
It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else
They say a secret is something you tell one other person
So I'm telling you, child
Love, we shine like a burning star
We're falling from the sky tonight
A man will beg
A man will crawl
On the sheer face of love
Like a fly on a wall
It's no secret at all
It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief
Oh love
Love, we shine like a burning star
We're falling from the sky tonight
A man will rise
A man will fall
From the sheer face of love
Like a fly from a wall
It's no secret at all

We're falling from the sky tonight

We're falling from the sky tonight

You know I'd come back, baby, if you gave me some room

Her golden voice, her beauty's beat
How she made us feel
How she made me real
And the ground beneath her feet
And the ground beneath her feet
And now I can't be sure of anything
Black is white and cold is heat
For what I worshipped stole my love away
It was the ground beneath her feet
It was the ground beneath her feet
Go lightly down your darkened way
Go lightly under ground
I'll be down there in another day
I won't rest until you're found
Let me love you, let me rescue you
Let me bring you where two roads meet
Oh, come back above where there is only love
Only love

My oh my
My oh my

If you tear yourself in two again

If I could, through myself, set your spirit free
I'd lead your heart astray
Just to see you break
Break away
Into the light
To the rain
Into the light
Out from over the flame
To let it go
So to fade away
To let it go
So fade away
Wide awake
Wide awake
Wide awake
I'm not sleeping
Oh, no
I'm not sleeping
Oh, no no no
If you should ask, well, maybe
They'd tell you what I would say
True colors fly in blue and black
Bruised silken skies and burning flak
Colours crash, collide in blood shot eyes
If I could, you know I would
If I could, I would let it go
This separation
Separation
Isolation
Not revelation
Isolation
Not revelation
Isolation
Let it go
So not fade away
To let it go
So not fade, fade, fade away
Fade away, fade away
Not fade away

These city lights, they shine as silver and gold
Took from the night, your eyes as black as coal
Walk on by, walk on through
Walk till you run and don't look back for here I am
Carnival, the wheels fly and the colours spin
Through alcohol, red wine that punctures the skin
Face to face in a dry and waterless place
Walk on by, walk on through
So sad to beseach your love so head on
Stay in this night, stay tonight in a lie
I'm only asking but I think you know
Come on and take me away
Come on and take me away
Come on, take me home
Home again
Ever, ever, ever high
And here she comes
Yet she's so far
And if the mountains should crumble
Or disappear into the sea
Not a tear, no not I
Stay in this time
Stay tonight in a lie
Ever after this loving time
And if you save your love
Save your love, save it all
Don't push me too far
Don't push me too far tonight
Tonight, tonight"
The Wanderer	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/the_wanderer-lyrics-18529.html	Zooropa	"I went out walking
Through streets paved with gold
Lifted some stones
Saw the skin and bones
Of a city without a soul
I went out walking
Under an atomic sky
Where the ground won't turn
And the rain it burns
Like the tears when I said goodbye
Yeah I went with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering
I went drifting
Through the capitals of tin
Where men can't walk
Or freely talk
And sons turn their fathers in
I stopped outside a church house
Where the citizens like to sit
They say they want the kingdom
But they don't want God in it
I went out riding
Down that old eight lane
I passed by a thousand signs
Looking for my own name
I went with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you
I went out there
In search of experience
To taste and to touch
And to feel as much
As a man can
Before he repents
I went out searching
Looking for one good man
A spirit who would not bend or break
Who would sit at his father's right hand
I went out walking
With a bible and a gun
The word of God lay heavy on my heart
I was sure I was the one
Now Jesus, don't you wait up
Jesus, I'll be home soon
Yeah I went out for the papers
Told her I'd be back by noon
Yeah I left with nothing
But the thought you'd be there too
Looking for you
Yeah I left with nothing
Nothing but the thought of you
I went wandering"

I like the time
I like the feeling when
I feel you in my arms
I'll take you in my hand
I'll let you go
Somebody save me
Somebody save me

Sing my, sing my song
We sing the same old song loud
Smile...though your heart breaks in two
Touch me...when will I be with you
I like good times
But I can feel it's going wrong
You sing the same old song
Now I think it's time to get it right
Sing it out, sing out...
Sing this same old song
If I could swim, I'd swim in circles
If I could drown, I'd, I'd drown with you
If I had enough of my life
I can't tell
If I had enough of you"
Treasure (Whatever Happened To Pete The Chop)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/treasure_whatever_happened_to_pete_the_chop-lyrics-18579.html	All That You Can't Leave Behind	"I like to smile but I like to mostly stay with you
I like good times but I can't feel this without you
By my song the heart is in the place
I sing this song probably so
If I could sigh I'd tell the world I'd felt with you
I like the time
I like the feeling when I feel you in my arms
I'll take you in my hand, I'll let you go
Dump her beside me
Dump her beside me
Sing it, sing my, sing my song
We sing the same old song loud
Smile though your heart breaks in two
Touch me, when will I be with you
I like good times but I can feel it's going wrong
You sing the same old song
Now I think it's time to get it right
Sing it out, sing out
Sing this same old song
If I could swim, I'd swim in circles
If I could drown, I'd, I'd drown with you
If I had enough of my life
I can't tell if I had enough of you
I run away, I watch you stand
My life should be alright
I like to watch, oh my, tonight
Somebody save"
Trip Through Your Wires	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/trip_through_your_wires-lyrics-18489.html	The Joshua Tree	"In the distance
She saw me coming 'round
I was calling out
I was calling out
Still shaking
Still in pain
You put me back together again
I was cold and you clothed me honey
I was down and you lifted me honey
Angel
Angel or devil
I was thirsty
And you wet my lips
You, I'm waiting for you
You, you set my desire
I trip through your wires
I was broken, bent out of shape
I was naked in the clothes you made
Lips were dry, throat like rust
You gave me shelter from the heat and the dust
No more water in the well
No more water, water
Angel
Angel or devil
I was thirsty
And you wet my lips
You, I'm waiting for you
You, You set my desire
I trip through your wires
(All I need...All I need)
Thunder, thunder on the mountain
There's a rain cloud in the desert sky
In the distance she saw me coming 'round
I was calling out
I was calling out"
Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/tryin_to_throw_your_arms_around_the_world-lyrics-18516.html	Achtung Baby	"Six o'clock in the morning
You're the last to hear the warning
You've been trying to throw your arms
Around the world
You've been falling off the sidewalk
Your lips move but you can't talk
Tryin' to throw your arms around the world
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Be still
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman I will
Sunrise like a nosebleed
Your head hurts and you can't breathe
You been tryin' to throw you arms around the world
How far you gonna go
Before you lose your way back home
You've been trying to throw your arms
Around the world
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman be still
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman I will
Yeah, I dreamed that I saw Dali
With a supermarket trolley
He was trying to throw his arms around a girl
He took an open top beetle
Through the eye of a needle
He was tryin' to throw his arms around the world
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman be still
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Oh, Woman I will
(And you just gotta, you just gotta make your faith...see...)
Nothin' much to say I guess
Just the same as all the rest
Been trying to throw your arms around the world
And a woman needs a man
Like a fish needs a bicycle
When you're tryin' to throw your arms around the world
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
I'm gonna run to you, run to you, run to you
Woman be still
Woman be still
Be still
Woman be still
Woman I will"

They're closed but I see something
A teacher told me why
I laugh when old men cry
My body grows and grows
It frightens me you know
The old man tried to walk me home
I thought he should have known
Twilight...
Twilight, lost my way
Twilight, can't find my way
In the shadow boy meets man
In the shadow boy meets man
In the shadow boy meets man
In the shadow boy meets man
I'm running in the rain
I'm caught in a late night play
It's all; it's everything
I'm soaking through the skin
Twilight...darkened day
Twilight...lost my way
Twilight...night and day
Twilight...can't find my way
Can't find your way
Can't find my way
Can't find your way
Twilight...darkened day
Twilight...lost my way
Twilight...night and day
Twilight...can't find my way

Two Shots Of Happy, One Shot Of Sad	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/two_shots_of_happy_one_shot_of_sad-lyrics-328337.html	If God Will Send His Angels	"Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
You think I'm no good, well I know I've been bad
Took you to a place, now you can't get back
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
Walk together down a dead end street
We were mixing the bitter with the sweet
Don't try to figure out what we might have had
Just two shots of happy, one shot of sad
I'm just a singer, some say a sinner
Rollin' the dice, not always a winner
You say I've been lucky, well hell, I made my own
Not part of the crowd but not feeling alone
Under pressure but not bent out of shape
Surrounded, we always found an escape
Drove me to drink but hey, thats not all bad
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
Guess I've been greedy all of my life
Greedy with my children, my lovers, my wife
Greedy for the good things as well as the bad
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
Maybe it's just talk, saloon singing
The chairs are all stacked, the swingers stopped swinging
You say I hurt you, you put the finger on yourself
Then after you did it you came crying for my help
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
I'm not complaining, baby, I'm glad
You call it compromise, well, whats that
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad
Two shots of happy, one shot of sad"
Ultra Violet - (Light My Way)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/ultra_violet_light_my_way-lyrics-39338.html	Achtung Baby	"Sometimes I feel like I don't know
Sometimes I feel like checkin' out
I want to get it wrong
Can't always be strong
And love it won't be long...
Oh sugar, don't you cry
Oh child, wipe the tears from your eyes
You know I need you to be strong
And the day is as dark as the night is long
Feel like trash, you make me feel clean
I'm in the black, can't see or be seen
Baby, baby, baby...light my way
(alright now)
Baby, baby, baby...light my way
You bury your treasure
Where it can't be found
But your love is like a secret
That's been passed around
There is a silence that comes to a house
Where no one can sleep
I guess it's the price of love
I know it's not cheap
(oh, come on)
Baby, baby, baby...light my way
(oh, come on)
Baby, baby, baby...light my way
Oh...ultraviolet...
Ultraviolet...
Ultraviolet...
Ultraviolet...
Baby, baby, baby...light my way
I remember
When we could sleep on stones
Now we lie together
In whispers and moans
When I was all messed up
And I had opera in my head
Your love was a light bulb
Hanging over my bed
Baby, baby, baby...light my way
(oh, come on)
Baby, baby, baby...light my way
Ultraviolet...
[Repeat 4 times]
Baby, baby, baby...
Baby, baby, baby...
Baby, baby, baby...light my way

A long and lonely time
And time goes by so slowly
And time can do so much
Are you still mine
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love
God speed your love to me
Lonely rivers fall to the sea, to the sea
To the open arms of the sea
Lonely rivers sigh
Wait for me
Wait for me
I'll be coming home
Wait for me

Until The End Of The World	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/until_the_end_of_the_world-lyrics-18511.html	Achtung Baby	"Haven't seen you in quite a while
I was down the hold just passing time
Last time we met was a low-lit room
We were as close together as a bride and groom
We ate the food, we drank the wine
Everybody having a good time
Except you
You were talking about the end of the world
I took the money
I spiked your drink
You miss too much these days if you stop to think
You lead me on with those innocent eyes
You know I love the element of surprise
In the garden I was playing the tart
I kissed your lips and broke your heart
You...you were acting like it was
The end of the world
(Love...love...)
In my dream I was drowning my sorrows
But my sorrows, they learned to swim
Surrounding me, going down on me
Spilling over the brim
Waves of regret and waves of joy
I reached out for the one I tried to destroy
You...you said you'd wait
'til the end of the world"
Van Diemen's Land	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/van_diemens_land-lyrics-18494.html	Rattle And Hum	"Hold me now, oh hold me now
'til this hour has gone around
And I'm gone on the rising tide
For to face Van Diemen's land
It's a bitter pill I swallow here
To be rent from one so dear
We fought for justice and not for gain
But the magistrate sent me away
Now kings will rule and the poor will toil
And tear their hands as they tear the soil
But a day will come in this dawning age
When an honest man sees an honest wage
Hold me now, oh hold me now
'til this hour has gone around
And I'm gone on the rising tide
For to face Van Diemen's land"

Lights go down
It's dark
The jungle is your head
Can't rule your heart
I'm feeling so much stronger
Than I thought
Your eyes are wide
And though your soul
it can't be bought
your mind can wander
Hello, Hello
Hola! [Spanish for Hello]
I'm at a place called vertigo (¿Dónde está?) [Where is it?]
It's everything I wish I didn't know
Except you give me something I can feel
Feel
The night is full of holes
Those bullets rip the sky
Of ink with gold
They twinkle as the boys play rock and roll
They know that they can't dance
At least they know
I can't stand the beat
I'm askin' for the cheque
Girl with crimson nails
Has Jesus 'round the neck
Swinging to the music
Swinging to the music
Woooao
Hello, Hello
Hola!
I'm at a place called Vertigo (¿Dónde está?) [Where is it?]
It's everything I wish I didn't know
But you give me something I can feel
Feel
All this, all this can be yours
All of this, all of this can be yours
All this, all of this can be yours
Just give me what I want
And no one gets hurt
Hello, Hello
Hola!
I'm at a place called Vertigo
Lights go down and all I know
Is that you give me something I can feel
You're teaching me ...aaahhh
Your love is teaching me ...aaaah

And a fucked up world it is too
Tell me, tell me the story
The one about eternity
And the way it's all gonna be
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN

Jesus, I'm waiting here boss
I know you're looking out for us
But maybe your hands aren't free
Your Father, He made the world in seven
He's in charge of Heaven
Will you put in a word for me
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN
Listen to your words they'll tell you what to do
Listen over the rhythm that's confusing you
Listen to the reed in the saxophone
Listen over the hum in the radio
Listen over sounds of blades in rotation
Listen through the traffic and circulation
Listen as hope and peace try to rhyme
Listen over marching bands playing out their time
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN
Jesus, were you just around the corner?
Did you think to try and warn her?
Or are you working on something new?
If there's an order in all of this disorder
Is it like a tape recorder?
Can we rewind it just once more?
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN
WAKE UP WAKE UP DEAD MAN"

It's not the easy thing
The only baggage
That you can bring
Not the easy thing
The only baggage you can bring
Is all that you can't leave behind
And if the darkness is to keep us apart
And if the daylight feels like it's a long way off
And if your glass heart should crack
Before the second you turn back
Oh no, be strong
Walk on
Walk on
What you got, they can't steal it
No they can't even feel it
Walk on
Walk on
Stay safe tonight
You're packing a suitcase for a place
None of us has been
A place that has to be believed
To be seen
You could have flown away
A singing bird
In an open cage
Who will only fly
Only fly for freedom
Walk on
Walk on
What you got
You can't deny it
Can't sell it or buy it
Walk on
Walk on
Stay safe tonight
And I know it aches
How your heart it breaks
You can only take so much
Walk on
Walk on
Home
Hard to know what it is
If you never had one
Home
I can't say where it is
But I know I'm going
Home
That's where the hurt is
And I know it aches
And your heart it breaks
You can only take so much
Walk on
Leave it behind
You've got to leave it behind
All that you fashion
All that you make
All that you build
All that you break
All that you measure
All that you steal
All this you can leave behind
All that you reason
All that you care
It's only time
And I'll never fill up all my mind (??)
All that you sense
All that you speak
All you dress up
And all that you scheme
All you create
All that you wreck
All that you hate"

She wore canvas shoes, white canvas shoes
Around her neck she wore a silver necklace
'It was given to me by my father' she said
'It was given to me'
She took the back way home past the lights at Summerhill
Turned left on to the north strand and on, out towards the sea
He said he was an artist but he really painted billboards
In large capital letters, in large capital letters
He was telling jokes, nobody else would listen to him
I saw you that day, your lips were cherry red
Your legs were crossed, your arms wide open
Your hair was coloured gold
And like a field of corn you were blown by the wind
You were blown by the wind
Walk, walk, walk to the water
Walk with me awhile
Walk, walk, walk to the roadside
Walk with me in a light
A room in the Royal hotel, the sea facing views
A man with a suitcase full of things he doesn't need
I'm looking through your window
I'm walking through your doorway
I'm on the outside, let me in
Let me love you
Let me love you
Let me
Walk, walk, walk to the water
Walk with me
Walk, walk, walk to the roadside
Walk with me a while"

What is it that you see
People find all kinds of things
That bring them to their knees
I see an expression
So clear and so true
That changes the atmosphere
When you walk to the room
So I try to be like you
Try to feel it like you do
But without you it's no use
I can't see what you see
When I look at the world
When the night is someone else's
And you're trying to get some sleep
When your thoughts are too expensive
To ever want to keep
When there's all kinds of chaos
And everyone is walking lame
You don't even blink now do you
Don't even look away
So I try to be like you
Try to feel it like you do
But without you it's no use
I can't see what you see
When I look at the world
I can't wait any longer
I can't wait 'til I'm stronger
Can't wait any longer
To see what you see
When I look at the world
I'm in the waiting room
I can't see for the smoke
I think of you and your holy book
When the rest of us choke
Tell me, tell me
What do you see
Tell me, tell me
What's wrong with me"

I was under the waves before love rescued me
I was a fighter, I could turn on a thread
Now I stand accused of the things I've said
When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town
Used to make love under a red sunset
I was making promises I was soon to forget
She was pale as the lace of her wedding gown
But I left her standing before love came to town
I ran into a juke joint when I heard a guitar scream
The notes were turning blue, I was dazing in a dream
As the music played I saw my life turn around
That was the day before love came to town
When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town
When love comes to town I'm gonna jump that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town
When I woke up I was sleeping on the street
I felt the world was dancing and I was dirt beneath their feet
When I looked up I saw the Devil looking down
But my Lord he played the guitar the day love came to town
I was there when they crucified my Lord
I held the scabbard when the soldier drew his sword
I threw the dice when the pierced his side
But I've seen love conquer the great divide
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that train
When love comes to town I'm gonna catch that flame
Maybe I was wrong to ever let you down
But I did what I did before love came to town

Don't you need it

I don't care how many mansions you live in on the hill
You need love
Gotta gotta gotta get it
Gotta gotta gotta get it
We need love
We need love
We need peace
We need joy
We need hope
We need salvation
Hallelujah, hallelujah
And we got to catch the glory of our own tree
Do the best you can, God understands
He holds the world in the palm of his hands
And I want you to know that
No more fighting in the gangs
No more killing in the streets
No more fighting each other
No more hunger
No more homeless
No more helpless
It ain't the glory

Where Did It All Go Wrong	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/where_did_it_all_go_wrong-lyrics-18573.html	All That You Can't Leave Behind	"Did you get it
Did you need it
Did you really
What you wanted
Was it good in the sun
Did you really have the fun
Did you crack it
Did you grab it
Did you reel it
Like a rabbit
Did you walk
Did you run
Did you move this here
Uh huh
And how could you do
And make it so, sing this song
Where did it all go wrong
Where did it all go wrong
Did you grab it
Did you want it
Is it really what you wanted
Did you run in the sun
Did you imitate a walk
Did you answer
Did you grab it
Did you gun it like a rabbit
Did you walk
Did you run
Can you feel you rising up
And how can you do
And when you sang it in the song
And it sank, and it threw
Where did it all go wrong
Did you drown it
Did you roll it
Did you smash it
Did you warm it
Did you clean it
Clean it up
Did you rub it
Did you soap
Did you screen it
Did you ream it
Did you ruin it
Did you feed it
Is warm in the sun
When the weather's getting warm
And the world is at your feet
And it is our time to say
It's all gone wrong
Where did it all go wrong
(Oh yeah, oh yeah)
You take me, baby, in circles, yes
Darling, darling, darling...I want you
Why oh, why oh, why oh...stony rose
You lose your guy
You walk on by
You walk on by
You walk on by
You walk on by
Did you lose the guy
Did you lose the guy
Did you lose the guy
Did you lose the guy..."
Where The Streets Have No Name	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/where_the_streets_have_no_name-lyrics-18482.html	The Joshua Tree	"I want to run, I want to hide
I want to tear down the walls that hold me inside
I want to reach out and touch the flame
Where the streets have no name
I want to feel sunlight on my face
See the dust cloud disappear without a trace
I want to take shelter from the poison rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building, then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there, I go there with you
It's all I can do
The cities a flood and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dust
I'll show you a place high on a desert plain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
We're still building, then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there, I go there with you
It's all I can do
Our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
Oh, see our love, see our love turn to rust
And we're beaten and blown by the wind
Blown by the wind
When I got there, I go there with you
It's all I can do"

What can I give back to God for the blessings he poured out on me
What can I give back to God for the blessings he poured out on me
I lift high the Cup of Salvation as a toast to our Father
To follow through on a promise I made to you from the heart
I want to run, I want to hide
I want to tear down the walls that hold me tonight
I want to reach out and touch the flame
Where the streets have no name
I want to feel sunlight on my face
I see the dust cloud disappear without a trace
I want to dance dance dance in the dirty rain
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Still building, then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there I go there with you
It's all I can do
The cities a flood and our love turns to rust
We're beaten and blown by the wind, trampled in dust
I'll show you a place with no sorrow, there's no shame
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Still we're building, then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there, I go there with you
It's all I can do
Where the streets have no name
Where the streets have no name
Still we're building, then burning down love
Burning down love
And when I go there, I go there with you
It's all I can do
It's all we can do
This is all we can do"

Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/whos_gonna_ride_your_wild_horses-lyrics-18512.html	Achtung Baby	"You're dangerous 'cause you're honest
You're dangerous, you don't know what you want
Well you left my heart empty as a vacant lot
For any spirit to haunt
Hey hey sha la la
Hey hey
You're an accident waiting to happen
You're a piece of glass left there on the beach
Well you tell me things I know you're not supposed to
Then you leave me just out of reach
Hey hey sha la la
Hey hey sha la la
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee
Well you stole it 'cause I needed the cash
And you killed it 'cause I wanted revenge
Well you lied to me 'cause I asked you to
Baby, can we still be friends
Hey hey sha la la
Hey hey sha la la
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna fall at the foot of thee
Oh, the deeper I spin
Oh, the hunter will sin for your ivory skin
Took a drive in the dirty rain
To a place where the wind calls your name
Under the trees the river laughing at you and me
Hallelujah, heavens white rose
The doors you open
I just can't close
Don't turn around, don't turn around again
Don't turn around, your gypsy heart
Don't turn around, don't turn around again
Don't turn around, and don't look back
Come on now love, don't you look back
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna drown in your blue sea
Who's gonna taste your salt water kisses
Who's gonna take the place of me
Who's gonna ride your wild horses
Who's gonna tame the heart of thee"
Wild Honey	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/wild_honey-lyrics-18569.html	All That You Can't Leave Behind	"In the days
When we were swinging form the trees
I was a monkey
Stealing honey from a swarm of bees
I could taste
I could taste you even then
And I would chase you down the wind
You can go there if you please
Wild honey
And if you go then go with me
Wild honey
Did I know you
Did I know you even then
Before the clocks began time
Before the world was made
From the cruel sun
You were sheltered
You were my shelter and my shade
If you go there with me
Wild honey
You can do just what you please
Wild honey
Yeah, just blowing in the breeze
Wild honey
Wild, wild, wild
I'm still standing
I'm still standing where you left me
Are you still growing wild
With everything tame around you
I send you flowers
Could flowers thaw you heart
I know your garden is full
But is there sweetness at all
What is soul
Love me
Give me soul
If you go then go with me
Wild honey
Won't you take me, take me please
Wild honey
Yeah, swinging through the trees
Wild honey
Wild, wild, wild"

Where do we go from here
Where to go
To the side of a hill
Blood was spilt
We were still looking
At each other
Oh, we're goin' back there
Jerusalem Jerusalem
Shout, shout
With a shout, shout it out
Shout...shout it out...
I wanna go
To the foot of the messiah
To the foot of he who made me see
To the side of a hill
Where we were still
We were filled
With our love
We're gonna be there again
Jerusalem Jerusalem
Shout, shout
With a shout
Shout...
With a shout"
With Or Without You	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/with_or_without_you-lyrics-18484.html	The Joshua Tree	"See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
I wait for you
Slight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you
With or without you
With or without you
Through the storm we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live
With or without you
And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
My hands are tied, my body bruised
She's got me with nothing left to win
And nothing else to lose

And you give yourself away
And you give
And you give
And you give yourself away
With or without you
With or without you
I can't live

Yahweh	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/yahweh-lyrics-219141.html	How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb	"Take these shoes
Click clacking down some dead end street
Take these shoes
And make them fit
Take this shirt
Polyester white trash made in nowhere
Take this shirt
And make it clean, clean
Take this soul
Stranded in some skin and bones
Take this soul
And make it sing
Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, Yahweh
Still I'm waiting for the dawn
Take these hands
Teach them what to carry
Take these hands
Don't make a fist
Take this mouth
So quick to criticise
Take this mouth
Give it a kiss
Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, Yahweh
Still I'm waiting for the dawn
Still waiting for the dawn, the sun is coming up
The sun is coming up on the ocean
This love is like a drop in the ocean
This love is like a drop in the ocean
Yahweh, Yahweh
Always pain before a child is born
Yahweh, tell me now
Why the dark before the dawn?
Take this city
A city should be shining on a hill
Take this city
If it be your will
What no man can own, no man can take
Take this heart
Take this heart
Take this heart
And make it break"
Your Blue Room	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/your_blue_room-lyrics-18531.html	Passengers: Original Soundtrack	"It's time to go again
To your blue room
Got some questions to ask of you
In your blue room
The air is clean
Your skin is clear
I've had enough of hangin' round here
It's a different kind of conversation
Your blue room
Saw me calling love, somewhere deep inside
Saw me calling you, somewhere I can hide
And time is a string of pearls
Your blue room
See the future just hanging there
Your blue room
And you crave
A new perspective
Looking down on my objectives
New instructions
Whatever their directions
Your blue room
Saw me calling love
(Bongolese)
Saw me calling
(Bongolese)
It's alright
Your blue room
One day I'll be back
Your blue room
Yeah, I hope I remember where it's at
Your blue room
See me slide
Won't you take me back there
So much fun to me
[Adam]
Zooming in
Zooming out
Nothing I can do about
A lens to see it all up close
Magnifying what everybody knows
Never in conflict
Never alone
No car alarm
No cellular phone"
Zoo Station	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/zoo_station-lyrics-18508.html	Achtung Baby	"I'm ready
I'm ready for the laughing gas
I'm ready
I'm ready for what's next
I'm ready to duck
I'm ready to dive
I'm ready to say
I'm glad to be alive
I'm ready
I'm ready for the push
The cool of the night
The warmth of the breeze
I'll be crawling 'round
On my hands and knees
Just down the line...Zoo Station
Gotta make it on time...Zoo Station
I'm ready
I'm ready for the gridlock
I'm ready...to take it to the street
I'm ready for the shuffle
Ready for the deal
Ready to let go of the steering wheel
I'm ready
Ready for the crush
(She's just down the line)...Zoo Station
(Got to make it on time)...Zoo Station
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, It's alright
Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, hey baby
It's alright, it's alright
(Alright, you can turn it up)
Time is a train
Makes the future the past
Leaves you standing in the station
Your face pressed up against the glass
I'm just down the line from your love...(Zoo Station)
You know I'm under the sign...(Zoo Station)
I've gotta make it on time
Make it on time...(Zoo Station)
That's alright...(Zoo Station)
Just two stops down the line...(Zoo Station)
Just a stop down the line..."
Zooropa	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/u2/zooropa-lyrics-18520.html	Zooropa	"(What do you want?)
(What do you want?)
Zooropa...vorsprung durch technik
Zooropa...be all that you can be
Be a winner
Eat to get slimmer
Zooropa...a bluer kind of white
Zooropa...it could be yours tonight
We're mild and green
And squeaky clean
Zooropa...better by design
Zooropa...fly the friendly skies
Through appliance of science
We've got that ring of confidence
And I have no compass
And I have no map
And I have no reasons
No reasons to get back
And I have no religion
And I don't know what's what
And I don't know the limit
The limit of what we've got
Don't worry baby, it'll be alright
You got the right shoes
To get you through the night
It's cold outside, but brightly lit
Skip the subway
Let's go to the overground
Get your head out of the mud baby
Put flowers in the mud baby
Overground
No particular place names
No particular song
I've been hiding
What am I hiding from
Don't worry baby, it's gonna be alright
Uncertainty can be a guiding light
I hear voices, ridiculous voices
Out in the slipstream
Let's go, let's go overground
Take your head out of the mud baby
She's gonna dream up
The world she wants to live in
She's gonna dream out loud
She's gonna dream out loud
Dream out loud"
