Ain't It All Amusing	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/elf/aint_it_all_amusing-lyrics-375547.html	Album: Carolina County Ball	"Baby if you flatter me, you might get somewhere
But I ain't gonna flatter you 'coz I don't really care
Ain't it all, ain't it all amusing
Now, now maybe if you get the sign, I might be a man
Baby you forgot the time, I'll do the best I can
Ain't it all, ain't it all, ain't it all amusing
Well, ain't it all, right, right, ain't it all amusing
Make me laugh.....
Hey, Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water
Jill fell down and broke her crown
And that's the way it oughta.....
Well, ain't it all now, all now, all, ain't it all amusing
I say, ain't it all, right, ain't it all amusing
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, Baby if you flatter me, you might get somewhere
But I ain't gonna flatter you 'coz I don't really care
Ain't it all, ain't it all amusing
Ha-ha
Well, ain't it all, right, right, ain't it all amusing
All amusing"
Annie New Orleans	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/elf/annie_new_orleans-lyrics-375546.html	Album: Carolina County Ball	"Aggravatin' Annie you're getting on my fanny
And I just can't cope any more
When it gets down to fundamentals
You're a bit confusing
You've got wrinkles on your face
But they seem to be in place
So I wonder well I wonder
Are you leading the young boy on?
Annie New Orleans
You're a hard core woman, a red necked woman
A good old girl from the South
With a negative way of speaking
But you're sentimental
We never speak of life but you want to be my wife
And I wonder, well I wonder
Are you leading the young boy on?
Annie New Orleans
Well didn't think I heard you at all
I was starting to fall
Back it up and try it again
I ain't letting you win, no way, all right
Aggravatin' Annie you're on my fanny
And I can't cope any more
When it gets down to fundamentals
Lady, you're confusing
Well, you've got some wrinkles on your face
But they're all in their place
So I wonder, I just wonder
Well are you leading the young boy on?
Annie New Orleans
Hey, Annie New Orleans
Oh, hey, Annie New Orleans
Yeah"
Black Swampy Water	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/elf/black_swampy_water-lyrics-783419.html	Album: Trying To Burn The Sun	"Oh yeah
Uh back in the wood
Where it's good
And the days are yellow
Well I saw me a child
She was wild
Like a lady going all out
Dark as the night
She was ripe
For a little conversation
So I pulled her right in
And she said
She had some imagination
Black swampy water
That's where I caught her
Black swampy water
Black swampy water
We didn't speak
For a week
Got tangled up in her hair
So we lay in the grass
What a gas
You can't know that you were there
So then I let it all go
And the show
Was like blowing up a freight train
And round the world I would go
Like jumping on a jet plane
Black swampy water
That's where I caught her
Black swampy water
Uh, what I taught her, yeah
Oh, back in the wood
Where it's good
And the days are yellow
Gotta saw me a child
She was wild
Like a lady going all out
I've been
Black swampy water
All right
That's where I caught her, oh
Black swampy water
Oh all the things that I taught her
Yes, again
Black swampy water, my my
Where I saw here, oh
Black swampy water
What I did when I caught her, oh yeah yeah"

Should we put it away
For a rainy day
Is my moon out tonight
Should I wake up today

Waiting for the man to take us down

And all the women that you know
Look just like men
Ah but it's smiling time again
And everybody wins
Good time music Is coming back today
Will the sun shine today
Should we keep it alive
Or lock it all up inside
Can we all find a way
To be happy again
When's it all gonna end
Life's too complicated
To do much more creating
Waiting for the man to take us down
And you can't have no money
The cloudy days aren't sunny
And all the women that you know
Look just like me
Ah but it's smiling time again
And everybody wins

Crazy kind of feeling, hanging from the ceiling
With a bag tied over my head
You won't let the sun shine in
But now you're very very happy that you're so happy
Very very happy for you
Looking round every corner
Look, I'm glad you're happy
Too much aggravation, time is kind of wasting
Got to get while I'm still alive
You're never gonna stop me now
But Lord you're very very happy, special situations
Very very happy, pleasant demonstration
Very very happy, special situation
Very very happy, pleasant demonstration

So sail away, into the sun
'Cause I'm everyone, yeah
Touch me, I feel
Take me, I'm real
Drift away, into the night
I'm the light"
