A Dangerous Mind	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/within_temptation/a_dangerous_mind-lyrics-320000.html	The Silent Force	"I'm searching for answers
cause something is not right.
I follow the sings,
I'm close to the fire.
I fear that soon you'll reveal
your dangerous mind.
Chorus:
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
I fear your smile and the promise inside.
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
I fear your presence, I'm frozen inside.
I'm searching for answers
not questioned before.
The curse of awareness,
there's no peace of mind.
As your true colours show
a dangerous sign.
Chorus:
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
I see the truth that you've buried inside.
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
There is no mercy, just anger I find.
I just hace to know, while I still have time.
Do I have to run, or hide away from you?
Chorus:
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
I see the truth that you've buried inside.
It's in your eyes, what's on your mind.
There is no mercy, just anger I find"
All I Need	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/within_temptation/all_i_need-lyrics-1002426.html	Heart Of Everything	"All I Need
I'm dying to catch my breath
Oh why don't i ever learn
I've lost all my trust that i'm sure we try to
Turn it around
Can you still see the heart of me
All my agony fades away
When you hold me in your embrace
Don't tear me down
For all i need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something I can believe
Don't turn me down
You're far from the door now
Don't let it close
He only had to go
I wish I could let it go
I know that I'm only one step away
From turning around
Can you still see the heart of me
All my agony fades away
When you hold me in your embrace
Don't tear me down
For all i need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something I can believe
Don't turn it down
What's left of me
Make my heart a better place
I've tried many times but nothing was real
Make it fade away
Don't break me down
I want to believe that this is for real
Save me from my fear
Don't turn me down
Don't tear me down
For all i need
Make my heart a better place
Don't tear me down
For all i need
Make my heart a better place
Give me something i can believe
Don't tear it down
What's left of me
Make my heart a better place"

I know you're going away
Lead my heart into a daze
I know you're going away
Leaves a void in my heart and soul

But I'm trying to get through to you
Wherever you are
Whatever you do
Don't you know, it depends on you

Blue Eyes	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/within_temptation/blue_eyes-lyrics-1127101.html	Heart Of Everything	"Blue eyes just smile to the world
Full of dreams and with fascination
Too soon she saw that her hands were chained and pulled
without any freedom
It’s always the same, the fear no way out
I cannot break it
I can take it no more
It's burning me up inside
Lost all my tears, can't cry
No reason, no meaning
Just hatred
No matter how hard I try
You fear the beast inside
It's growing, it's waiting
Just to hurt you
This heart was hurt by the light and
I see your world that tries to deny
Now everything that I love has died or has been shattered to pieces
It’s always the same, the fear no way out
I cannot break it
I can take it no more
It's burning me up inside
Lost all my tears, can't cry
No reason, no meaning
Just hatred
No matter how hard I try
You fear the beast inside
It's growing, it's waiting
Just to hurt you
Just to hurt you
Just to hurt you
Can’t you see their eyes, what lies inside
They’ve given up, they no longer shine
Too soon they close with one last cry
Before they turn to white
Just to hurt you
It's burning me up inside
Lost all my tears, can't cry
No reason, no meaning
Just hatred
No matter how hard I try
You fear the beast inside
It's growing, it's waiting
Just to hurt you
Just to hurt you"
Caged	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/within_temptation/caged-lyrics-39481.html	Mother Earth	"These are the darkest clouds
To have surrounded me
Now I find my self alone caught in a cage
There's no flower to be found in here
Not withering
Or pale to me
Everyone with a friendly face
Seems to hide some secret inside
He told me he loved me
While he laughed in my face
He just led me astray
He took my virtue
I feel so cold inside
Sorrow has frozen my mind
My heart is covered
With thoughts entangled
How could it ever have felt so real?
Is there a place more lonely than I feel within?
Could I have seen?
Could I have known?
I just took it as the truth
Everyone with a friendly face
Seems to hide some secret inside
Always there to remind me
To keep me from believing
That someone might be there
Who'll free me and never ever leave me"

You haven't made your peace
Live life, breathe, breathe

About the dream not meant to be
In a world of the free
He plays with your mind
As faith for the future faded fast
He grows strong with their displeasure
It sets him free
Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules again
He feeds on fear
Poisons the truth
To gain their faith
To lead the way
To a world of decay
He rules your heart
He will sell your soul to the grave
No hesitation he'll make
He belongs to the dark
Please awake
And see the truth
He can only be
If you believe what he tells you
Remember who you are
What you stand for
And there will always be a way
In my heart there is a place
In my heart there is a trace
Of a small fire burning
A sheltering ray shines through this night
Although it 's small, it's bright
But darkness is lurking
He will sell your soul to bitterness and cold
Fear him
Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
He rules with fear
Deceiver of hearts
Deceiver of fools
Shall he rule again?"

All I am not
Did you ever look behind
Aren't you afraid of the pieces you'll find

It's so easy to destroy
and condemn
The ones you do not understand
do you ever wonder if it's justified
It's so easy to destroy
and condemn
The ones you do not understand
in your life why didn't you ever try
I close my eyes as I walk the thin line
between love and hate
For the person with the same blood in his vains
You show no regrets
about all the things you did or said
I have failed you
but believe me
you failed me too

I've given my final moment,
But it's turning back on me
On every corner I turn i can feel it waiting
And just a moment of awareness,
I can easily slip away.
And then I'll be gone FOREVER!
I'm searching
I'm finding for a way to get through.
To turn it away.
It's reigning, always trying.
Feel the hands of fate
They're suffocating.
Tell me what's the reason?
Is it only inside my head?
Can't take it no more.
All around me I see danger
And it's closing in on me
Every second I can hear it
Breathing
I can't stand the feeling inside of me.
'Cause the speed of me is jaded.
And it will be my end.
I'm searching
I'm finding for a way to get through
To turn it away.
It's reigning, always trying.
Feel the hands of fate
They're suffocating.
Tell me what's the reason?
Is it only inside my head?
Can't take it no more.
But no one faced what's coming my way.
And I will let my fear fade away
Whatever may be, I'll have to find out.
It's reigning, always trying.
Feel the hands of fate
They're suffocating.
Tell me what's the reason?
Is it only inside my head?
Can't take it no more."

Couldn't save you from the start
Love you so it hurts my soul
Can you forgive me for trying again?
Your silence makes me hold my breath
All the time has passed you by
For so long, I've tried to shield you from the world
You couldn't face the freedom on your own
Here I am
Left in silence
You gave up the fight
You left me behind
All that stands forgiven
You'll always be mine
I know deep inside
All that stands forgiven
Watched the clouds drifting away
Still the sun can't warm my face
I know it was destined to go wrong
You were looking for the great escape
To chase your demons away
For so long, I've tried to shield you from the world
You couldn't face the freedom on your own
Here I am
Left in silence
You gave up the fight
You left me behind
All that stands forgiven
You'll always be mine
I know deep inside
All that stands forgiven
I've been so lost since you've gone
Why not me before you?
Why did fate deceive me?
Everything turned out so wrong
Why did you leave me in silence?
You gave up the fight
You left me behind
All that stands forgiven
You'll always be mine
I know deep inside
All that stands forgiven"

And The Land That We Conquered
It Just Washed Away

To Turn Back The Time
It Was All In Vain

So cold my hair is frozen,
Touching my skin, my flesh.
Sometimes I regret I had to do,
'Cause our love was somehow true.
But I had to leave you,
For the sake of the moods.
Frozen tears turn into my skin.
Frozen memories of you.
Sometimes I see your face,
As pure as you are mine.
I feel the darkness on my shoulder,

Touching my skin, my flesh.

Hand Of Sorrow	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/within_temptation/hand_of_sorrow-lyrics-1026941.html	Heart Of Everything	"Hand Of Sorrow
The child without a name grew up to be the hand
To watch you, to shield you, or kill on demand
The choice he made he could not comprehend
He's got a grim secret they had to command
He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life
He prayed for both but was denied
So many dreams are broken and so much we sacrifice
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind
So many years have past toward a noble land of lies
Will all our sins be justified?
The curse of his powers tormented his life
Obeying the crown was a sinister crime
His soul was tortured by love and by pain
He surely would flee but the oath made him stay
He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life
He prayed for both but was denied
So many dreams are broken and so much we sacrifice
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind
So many years have past toward a noble land of lies
Will all our sins be justified?
Please forgive me for the sorrow
For leaving you in fear
For the dreams we had to silence
That's all there'll ever be
Still I'll be the hand that saves you
Though you'll not see that it is me
So many dreams are broken and so much we sacrifice
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind
So many years have past toward a noble land of lies
Will all our sins be justified?"

On cold wings she's coming
You better keep moving

You better believe it.
When she embraces
Your heart turns to stone
She comes at night when you are all alone
And when she whispers
Your blood shall run cold
You better hide before she finds you
Whenever she is raging
She takes all life away

Haven't you seen?
The ruins of our world
She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak
The sun awakes and melts it away
The world now opens its eyes and sees
The dawning of a new day
Whenever she is raging
She takes all life away
Haven't you seen?

At the end of a closing day
A little child was born and raised
Deep in the forest on a hidden place
Mother never saw his face
Ancient spirits of the forest
Made him king of elves and trees
He was the only human being
Who lived in harmony
In perfect harmony
The woods protected, fulfillled his needs
Fruit by birds, honey by bees
He found shelter under trees
He grew up in their company
They became his family
A thousand seasons
They passed him by
So many times, have said goodbye
And when the spirits called out his name
To join forever, forever to stay
A forest spirit he became"

Why, you just won't leave my mind ?
Was this the only way ?
I couldn't let you stay ?
Run away, hide away
the secrets in your mind.
Sacrificed just her life,
for a higher love
No matter how many stones you put inside.
She'll always keeps on floating in your mind.
With every turn of your head you see her face again,
until the end, over and over again.
Why, you just won't leave my mind ?
Was this the only way ?
I couldn't let you stay ?
Told the truth she laughed at you.
Something snapped inside.
She had to go or they would know,
all you tried to hide
The sins of your life are now catching up with you.
You can't stay ahead. There's nothing you can do.
With every turn of your head you see her face again,

Rivers and mountains she creates
But you'll never know
The next move she'll make
You can try
But it is useless to ask why
Cannot control her
She goes her own way
She rules until the end of time
She gives and she takes
She rules until the end of time
She goes her own way
With every breath
And all the choices that we make
We are only passing through on her way
I find my strength
Believing that your soul lives on
Until the end of time
I'll carry it with me
Once you will know my dear
You don't have to fear
A new beginning always starts at the end
Until the end of time
She goes her own way"

And fallen in the end
Kingdoms have risen
Then buried by sand
The Earth is our mother

She puts us to sleep and
In her light we'll awake
We'll all be forgotten
There's no endless fame
But everything we do
Is never in vain
We're part of a story, part of a tale
We're all on this journey
No one is to stay
Where ever it's going
What is the way?
Forests and deserts
Rivers, blue seas
Mountains and valleys
Nothing here stays
While we think we witness
We are part of the scene
This never-ending story
Where will it lead to?
The earth is our mother
She gives and she takes
But she is also a part
A part of the tale

We're all on this journey

Where ever it's going

We're part of a story, part of a tale
Sometimes beautiful and sometimes insane
N o one remembers how it began."

Our Farewell	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/within_temptation/our_farewell-lyrics-39480.html	Mother Earth	"In my hands
A legacy of memories
I can hear you say my name
I can almost see your smile
Feel the warmth of your embrace
But there is nothing but silence now
Around the one I loved
Is this our farewell?
Sweet darling you worry too much, my child
See the sadness in your eyes
You are not alone in life
Although you might think that you are
Never thought
This day would come so soon
We had no time to say goodbye
How can the world just carry on?
I feel so lost when you are not by my side
But there's nothing but silence now
Around the one I loved
Is this our farewell?
So sorry your world is tumbling down
I will watch you through these nights
Rest your head and go to sleep
Because my child, this not our farewell.
This is not our farewell."

Santus, espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour
Santus, espiritus, insanity is all around us
(santus, espiritus...)
In my darkest hours
I could not foresee
That the time could turn so fast to this degree
Can't believe my eyes
How can you be so blind
Is the heart of stone nowhere but fear inside
Time keeps on slipping away
And we haven't learned
So in the end they won't have free sky
Santus, espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour
Santus, espiritus, insanity is all around us
Santus, espiritus is this what we deserve
Can we break free
From chains of neverending agony
Aren't they themselves to blame
The misery, the pain
That I will let go
Allow to let it grow
If we can't restrain
The beast which dwells inside
It will find its way somehow, somewhere in time
Will we remember all of the suffering
Cause if we may heal the fear in vain
Santus, espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour
Santus, espiritus, insanity is all around us
Santus, espiritus is this what we deserve
Can we break free
From chains of neverending agony
Santus, espiritus
Santus, espiritus
Santus, espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour
Santus, espiritus, insanity is all around us
Santus, espiritus is this what we deserve
Can we break free
From chains of neverending agony

From chains of neverending agony"
Overcome	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/within_temptation/overcome-lyrics-866367.html	The Silent Force	"Where are the heroes
In my time of need
Is my crying abandoned?
Or have they gone Oh no
They just tend to stand
Out of the rain
Thinking but not acting
That they're not to blame
Falling and crawling
A fight to stand up
Memory still haunts me
In the dead of night
Over and over
I felt so small
But one day I'll be stronger
And you better watch out
I will overcome
In violence there's silence
Oh no, It can't be undone
I will overcome
Knowing that I'm not the only one
I will overcome
It's the only way to carry on
Where are the saviours
Afraid of the toll
Sorry do my nine inch nails
Slash your soul?
Such heroes
Throwing stones
Straight at the one
Who is standing alone?
Twisting and turning
It's always the same
The truth is never honest
When you're to blame
Pushing and pulling
Never give in
One day I wish
You see you're not so beautiful within
Run and run"

Use The Time That I Have
I Can Say Goodbye

Have To Find

It Will Be Alright
I Know
I Should Realize

It Is Worth While

I pray now that soon you're released
To where you belong

You will find me in the world of yesterday
You drift away again
Too far from where I am

Nothing's ever changed, Just a turn away
You've washed your hands
You've made that all too clear
You just keep on living this lie
You refuse to see I'm in agony
The cross I bear
But you don't seem to care
Even Judas knew he had lied
I keep wondering why I'm still calling your name through my tears
Why have you waited to embrace me, my dear?
Cold is your silence, denying what is real
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name, my dear
I'm sorry if you can't stand the naked truth
All you see is how you want it to be
So you keep on living your lie
Release me from this cross after all these years
Call my name and help me with this weight
Even though it comes far too late
I keep wondering why I'm still calling your name through my tears
Why have you waited to embrace me, my dear?
Cold is your silence, denying what is real
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name
And I wonder, oh I wonder
If my heart is too hold/cold, can we open the door?
Can we ever find it all and save my heart?
Why have you waited to embrace me, my dear?
Cold is your silence, denying what is real
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name, my dear"

They had no chance, it was no fight
You can't kil what has been killed before,

The journey ends in death
You are giving up so easily
You are the other half of me
Over the hills [4x]
We are drifting apart
Chilled to the marrow, cause you don't want to go
Cause we've got a different wish at heart
The amulet guides us to the other side
When I go down it's you who'll bleed

After the night he died
I wept my tears until they dried
But the pain stayed the same
I didn't want him to die all in vain
I made a promise to revenge his soul in time
I'll make them bleed at my feet

Could I have known their true intentions?
As the pain stayed the same

The doubt within my soul
No longer I can justify
The bloodshed in his name
Is it a sin to seek the truth, the truth beneath the rose?
Pray with me so I will find the gate to Heaven's door
I believed it would justify the means
It had a hold over me
Blinded to see
The cruelty of the beast
Here is the darkest side of me
(Forgive me my sins)
The field of my dreams
Deceived all I have seen
Forgive me for what I have been
(Forgive me my sins)
Pray for me 'cause I have lost my faith in holy wars
This paradise denied to me 'cause I can't take no more
Has darkness taken over me
Consumed my mortal soul?
All my virtues sacrificed
Can Heaven be so cruel?
I believed it would justify the means
It had a hold over me
(Forgive me my sins)
Blinded to see
The cruelty of the beast
Here is the darkest side of me
(Forgive me my sins)
The field of my dreams
Deceived all I have seen
Forgive me for what I have been
(Forgive me my sins)
I'm hoping, I'm praying
I won't get lost between two hearts
Follow a sin
The truth lies in between
Give me the strength to face the wrong that I have done
Now that I know
The darkest side of me
How can blood be your salvation
And justify the pain
That we have caused throughout the times
Will I learn what's truly sacred
Will I redeem my soul
Will truth set me free
Blinded to see
The cruelty of the beast
Here is the darkest side of me
(Forgive me my sins)
The field of my dreams
Deceived all I have seen
Forgive me for what I have been

What have you done now?
Would you mind if I killed you?
Would you mind if I tried to
Cause you have turned into my worst enemy?
You carry hate that I feel
It's over now
What have you done
What have you done now
I, I've been waiting for someone like you
But now you are sleepping away
What have you done now?
Why, Why does fate make us suffer
There's a curse between us
Between me and you
What have you done?
What have you done now?
What have you done?
What have you done now?
I will not fall
Won't let it go
We will be free
When it ends
I, I've been waiting for someone like you
But now you are sleepping away
What have you done now?
Why, Why does fate make us suffer
There's a curse between us
Between me and you"
World Of Make Believe	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/within_temptation/world_of_make_believe-lyrics-325532.html	Mother Earth	"On golden wings
She flies at night
With her dress
It's blinding white
Countless diamonds
And her long blonde hair
The queen is coming
So you better be aware
Her plums and flowers
They're never the same
Blue and silver
It's all her game
Flying dragons
And enchanted woods
She decides, she creates
It's her reality
[REF:] In her world of dreams and make believe
She reigns forever
With all her glory
Unicorns appear in her sight
The fireflies lead her trough these woods at night
In search of the legendary amulet
And it's secret
In the big oak there is a door
Which will lead her
To the wizard shore
And she'll ask him
For the wind to sail her home
To the world where she belongs
[REF:] In her world of dreams and make believe
She reigns forever
With all her glory
In this world of endless fantasy
She makes it happen
It's her reality
[REF:] In her world of dreams and make believe
She reigns forever
With all her glory
In this world of endless fantasy
She makes it happen
It's her reality"
