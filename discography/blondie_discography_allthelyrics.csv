(Can I) Find The Right Words (To Say)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/can_i_find_the_right_words_to_say-lyrics-102613.html	The Hunter	"Look up the right words
The ones for today
And use them correctly
And mean what I say
Answer the questions
Crossword confession
Interrogation
I'm down, can we meet
Is it true, do you cheat?
How far can I go?
How much do you know?
What's the definition?
How much did she mention?
How much does she know?
Can I find the right words to say?
The right words are so hard to say
It's a challenger puzzle
From the magazine section
Across with the questions
Do the ethics of reference
One hundred twenty brain teasers to torment you
One hundred thoughts
I can't find the right words to say
My meaning's not quite getting through
The right words are so hard to say
Can I find the right words for you?
Let's not hedge our bets
'Cause the odds are dependent
Please listen instead
Now the whispers are ending
The point's misleading
As points often do
Can I find the right words for you?"
(I'm Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/im_always_touched_by_your_presence_dear-lyrics-102709.html	Plastic Letters	"Was it destiny?
I don't know yet
Was it just by chance?
Could this be kismet?
Something in my consciousness told me you'd appear
Now I'm always touched by your presence dear
When we play at cards you use an extra sense
It's really not cheating, you know?
You can read my hand I've got no defense
When you send your messages, whispered loud and clear
I'm always touched by your presence dear
Floating pass the evidence of possibilities
We could navigate together psychic frequencies
Coming into contact with outer entities
We could entertain each one with our theosophy
Stay awake at night and count your REM's
When you're talking with your super friends
Levitating lovers in the secret stratosphere
I am still in touch with your presence dear
I am still in touch with your presence dear"
11:59	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/1159-lyrics-102571.html	Parallel Lines	"Leaning in your corner like a candidate for wax.
Sidewalk social scientist don't get no satisfaction from your cigarette
It's ten to ten.
Time is running out.
Lock up all your memories.
Get outa here, you know that we can run.
Today can last another million years.
Today could be the end of me.
It's 11:59, and I want to stay alive.
Pumping like a fugitive in cover from the night.
Take it down the freeway like a bullet to the ocean.
Wait until the morning, take tomorrow by the hand.
Take it down the highway like a rocket to the ocean.
We can run.
Today can last another million years.
Today could be the end of me.
It's 11:59, and I want to stay alive.
Hanging on a frequency, burning like a fire.
Boy, you've got the motion down.
It's getting late, I'm tired and I've lost control.
Don't leave me here.
Time is running out.
Take me down the highway like a rocket to the ocean.
We can run.
Today can last another million years.
Today could be the end of me.
It's 11:59, and I want to stay alive."

In the sun, I'm waiting for the day and having fun, in warm far away.
Moonlight nights, water seems so clear.
Ooh, city lights I'm still waiting here...
In the sun, it's for everyone.
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun.
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube.
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love.
New York isle is covered by gray.
Concrete pile, blues play my way.
Tropic haze, pineapple sky.
Oh, perfect wave, hurricane eye.
In the sun, it's for everyone.
In the sun, we're gonna have some fun.
In the sun, we're gonna shoot the tube.
I'll do it for you, my paka lola luau love.

99 Red Balloons	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/99_red_balloons-lyrics-1024308.html	-	"You and I in a little toy shop
buy a bag of balloons with the money we've got
Set them free at the break of dawn
'Til one by one, they were gone
Back at base, bugs in the software
Flash the message, ""Something's out there""
Floating in the summer sky
99 red balloons go by.
99 red balloons floating in the summer sky
Panic bells, it's red alert
There's something here from somewhere else
The war machine springs to life
Opens up one eager eye
Focusing it on the sky
Where 99 red balloons go by.
99 Decision Street, 99 ministers meet
To worry, worry, super-scurry
Call the troops out in a hurry
This is what we've waited for
This is it boys, this is war
The president is on the line
As 99 red balloons go by.
99 Knights of the air
ride super-high-tech jet fighters
Everyone's a Superhero
Everyone's a Captain Kirk
With orders to identify
To clarify and classify
Scramble in the summer sky
As 99 red balloons go by.
99 dreams I have had
In every one a red balloon
It's all over and I'm standin' pretty
In this dust that was a city
If I could find a souvenier
Just to prove the world was here...
And here is a red balloon
I think of you and let it go."
A Shark In Jet's Clothing	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/a_shark_in_jets_clothing-lyrics-102578.html	Blondie	"I always had my eyes on you
But you came from across the line
I had to make good time to see you
But you had to pay the fine
All the boys on my side knew that, you were the shark
If you were found on the borderline you'd be shot in the dark
Don't wear those clothes again they don't make it in this crowd
Don't go out DTK you'll wear your best suit in the ground
We're meeting in a neutral zone
The last car on the train
The love you brought shaking up my bones and crawling through our veins
We always met at the edge of a blade and we left at the end of the fight
Of all the girls you've played and you laid
Why did this one have to be white?
They're gonna get you at 12 o'clock high
Got their sights set low on you
You better believe me I wouldn't lie
We better quit before you're through
They're gonna getcha at 12 o'clock high
Got their sights set low on you
You better believe me I wouldn't lie
We better quit before you're through
Ohhh"

Accidents Never Happen	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/accidents_never_happen-lyrics-102574.html	Eat To The Beat	"No I don't believe in luck
No I don't believe in circumstance no more
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
So I won't believe in luck
I saw you walking in the dark
So I slipped behind your footsteps for a while
Caught you turning round the block
Fancy meeting in a smaller world, after all
Accidents never happen, could have planned it all
Precognition in my ears
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Complications disappear
Now you love me
I, yeah, I can tell
I never lied, I never cried
And you, you knew so well
Like the Magi on the hill
I can divinate your presence from afar
And I'll follow you until
I can bring you to a perfect world
Accidents never happen, could have planned it all
Precognition in my ears
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Complications disappear
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Accidents never happen
Accidents never happen in a perfect world
Accidents never happen"

The drinks, and the laugh's, on me.
Pardon me, hehe, but I gotta run.

I gotta find who's my number one and why my angel eyes ain't here.
'scuse me while I disappear."
Angels On The Balcony	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/angels_on_the_balcony-lyrics-102576.html	Autoamerican	"Afterglow in a distant row.
The door is open and the lights are cold.
The children come in here and they dare the ghost, like a fire burning in a stone.
Silent light in the theatre's sky.
Phantom cigarette and a silent cry.
The door swings open and it's cold outside.
Run and hide, run and hide.
They can still see him singing on the corner.
Singing songs that never fade away, fade into the kids that come along.
Memory in a silent seat.
Melody on a long retreat.
Like an angel on a balcony.
Like an angel on a balcony."

Your plan, your plan backfired
Backfired
My man, your plan backfired in your face
You came into my life to test me
Your diplomatic drag depressed me

Make you die die die die die.
Say goodbye bye bye bye bye.

Fly away on a cloud. I know bad dreams.

Leaving for some fun in the hot tropic sun (back next Monday)
And our friends are at the airport
Cousin Bill says,
""Enjoy the water sports""
As we fly into the mystery
The film comes on and the Earth recedes
Several hours out - 20 minutes south of Bermuda
The communication's gone - something has to be so wrong
And it must be Jesus calling
The silver ship, the blue sea falling
Death was in that poison wave and in its gulf a fitting grave
The coast guard said they might be found
They know just where the plane went down"

Toss, turn, start to burn, top floor lands in bed.
You watch TV but there's nothing on the screen.
Spotlight on the visual -- nothing on the beam.
Call the handy man to come fix your machine,

We're too close, too close for comfort now!
Buckle up that seat belt baby, it's gonna be a bumpity bump.

The way that you move turns my page over.
They way that you love turns me around.
I'll be you pet when you say roll over.
I'll be your best bet if you'll be my guy.
The way that you look makes me bugeye.
The way that you love makes me high.
The way that you move heats my burner.
The way the you love make me sigh."

They were all I wanted to be.
I had the stars on my wall.
18 I was guaranteed.
I would lose my teenage dream.

Communion	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/communion-lyrics-102617.html	Debravation	"I've touched some objects of faith more precious than pieces of eight.
Seen sacred places and ritual ways, but for communion let's go to my place.
I learned to pray on my knees.
Been taken in hand, if you please.
Had my own revelations, ideas about fate, but for communion let's go to my place.
So as the body, so as the blood, sacred as the soul is to love.
Don't be mistaken if you don't understand, divinely simple.
Part of the plan.
Take!
Eat!
This is my body!
I give it to you.
Take!
Drink!
This is my blood.
Do it in remembrance of me (so you won't forget me).
Now, I've been a witness of grace.
Iêve stared sacred days in the face.
The long long parade of ritual ways, but for communion let's go to my place.
Sacred stories are told.
They're passed on like pieces of gold.
So make your conclusions, consider your fate, and for communion let's go to my place.
Are you ready?
Are you ready for communion?"

Although I'm young I got a job to do.
Hid the microfilm in the lining of my shoe.
Call it a business trip.
Got to hide inside my trenchcoat and be clever .
I got my papers and a cyanide pill.
My polaroid's a taser in disguise.
There's a base in the hills, and the wheat fields looks like Kansas in November.
Astrovia, sweet comrade, your nation is your gun.
Your love reads like the broken code you sent me.
One last contact in red square, unless I have to run and the long arms of the K.G.B. detect me.
Can't trust a soul, secret messenger, just the rules that lie like circuits in your brain and a cool .45.
The wind is ice and foreign air tastes strange.
I.C.B.M.
Bang! Bang! You're dead!
No one left to worry.
Kiss me quick, now I have to hurry.
Our last contact in red square, unless I have to run and the long arms of the C.I.A. detect me.
Hey!
Hey! Hey!"

In between the stations
Be my satellite
Secret information
Stairway
Going one way to the subway
Waiting for the train
Take it to the runway
Journal in the Square
Fingers in the hairdo
England in the air
Beatle in the bathroom
No one understands you
Upperhands you lonely valentine
Bell and book and candle
Turning in the light
Singing to the doorway
Standing on the side
Listen to the subway
Highway going
One way or another
Let's get in the car

Slips in behind ya, long overdue.

Sunlight's blinding shuts my eyes.
Sunset sliding = my time to rise and be dancing down the moon.
You whisper to me  Don't fear the dark.
Come closer darlin', you'll feel the spark.
I'll hold you tighter tight as I can, moving together hard as we can.
Sunlight, don't burn me.
Sunlight, be cool.
Moonlight's kind to me.
I'm in night school and I'm dancing down the moon.
Should I watch the night, be dreamless?
Stay away from light, be seen less?
Am I sleeping?
Stay awake all night.
Night comes a crawlin', curlin' round you.
Slips in behind ya, long overdue.
You'll be dancing down the moon.
I love the moonight.
I love the night.
Oh baby, hold me tight now.
I want you near me when it's five o'clock in the morning.
It's hangin' overhead.
We should be home sleepin' or in bed doin' it!

Beating the bongo.
Dig up the conjo.

To confess in the sun hold your breath.
Something comes.
It's alright.

Keeps away the wicked badly meant for me.
All I need is a sign.
Make your presence known to mine.
Come to me, and I will be divine.
And when I thought my fire finally died, I felt your spell, tight as ever, tied.
No one is above the rituals of love.
Temptation calls and the stars fall from the blue.
There is no limitation except for me and you.
Lived through all the romance sadly meant for me.

Walk on glass with the master
There's no question he can't answer with his eyes
What a stage, oh, what a dancer
Looks like a baby with an old man's eyes
When you break the rules and you burn your bridges
And your fingers itch and they're getting wet when you look at her
Do the dark apostle

You had a rendezvous with somebody new!
It's the only one I've ever had.
Baby, baby doncha go 'way mad.
The cheating shows and it never goes.
You've got a reason to be mad, I suppose.
She was only just a passing fad.
Baby, baby doncha go 'way mad.
Her kind's a dime a dozen.
That's not the kind you want.
Who would have thought your cousin would wander into that restaurant?
Well, you understand that I feel upset.
Whatd ya say that we forgive and forget?
Come and kiss me just to prove you're glad.
Baby, baby doncha go 'way mad.
Now her kind is a dime a dozen.
You should have passed her by.
Who would have thought your cousin would come along and give us the eye?
Well, you understand that I feel upset.
Whatd ya say that we forgive and forget?
Come and kiss me just to prove you're glad.
Oh, I don't know.

Double Take	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/double_take-lyrics-102641.html	No Exit	"Looking for your face where it could never be.
I'm following a trail that only I can see.
Raising waves of heat.
I press on in tiny bursts of speed.
Caught in my pursuit, I play the fetishist admission.
The longing that I feel drives me mad in no direction.
Nailed by something cute, I tear it out with microsurgical precision.
Incender.
Put some gas on the ember.
Lightning goes to ground.
Incender.
Crazy fool on a bender.
Striking the ground.
Burning me down.
Double take.
Left with an aftertaste.
I look again.
Was it your face?
Double take.
I'm in an altered state.
I look again.
Was it really you?
Another flash of face, igniting and familiar pulls me by the eye to the perimiter.
Riviting my gaze.
Is that your face in the crowd?
Incender.
Drop some gas on the ember.
I felt a slap on the face.
Incender.
Crazy fool on a bender.
Striking the ground, burning me down.
Double take.
Left with an aftertaste.
I look again.
Was it your face?
I fell awake.
I'm in an altered state.
I look again.
Was it really you?

Dragonfly	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/dragonfly-lyrics-102642.html	Platinum Collection	"Greetings Ladies and Gentlemen of Earth and all native intelligences
of the forty planets, satellites, moons, stars,
and any other inhabited orbs
with contestants entered in the annual Grande Trex,
the only inter-galactic race.
This year's event promises excitement to surpass all previous races.
As many of you fans already know the route or track of the orbits, glides, etc.
has been increased by 5,000 million kilometers
thus enabling Grande Trex to include the B'Arc System,
in our present event and for all succeeding GT races.
Dragonfly Dragonfly
Satellite
Strike and fight
Laser light shot tonight
Target nullified
Gyro subdivide
Latitude longitude
Satellite
Solid substitute
What's a drag race? Can't you see those dragons
Speeding up the street
But I learned they weren't real
Figments of the ancient fear
Rapid scan radians
For the chance
To win the Grande
Maneuvers preprogramme
Windage
Won't operate
Negative bearing swell
Dragons fly they symbolize in myth and saga breathing fire
Look up there's one flying higher
Faster than the SCC
Is science hiding witchery?
Grande Trex fans throughout the universe are well informed
on the risks pilots take in entering this race, i.e.
re-entry into some of the alien atmospheres is tricky business
which can cause a craft to implode, explode, melt,
lose automatic structure, etc., while en route.
The craft are scheduled to surface launch 0700.5100
Greenwich time and are assembled on one of our very own stars,
Neutron Einstar EV 9.
The excitement is at a fevered pitch as the countdown approaches zero.
These hypersonic inertial transition ships
can calculate the negligible quantity of spherical differential for tight orbit,
are sonar-radar balanced and translate windage occurrence,
offset verniers, retrieve, execute prepare,
delay code and report astrogational error in a micro-second.
Naturally these specialized craft are equipped with apparatus capable
of highly sensitive maneuverability.
They can dive, sweep, run random parallel paths,
alternate axes, circumnavigate for rapid survey, spin,
count milibaricly while simultaneously displaying an accurate diagram grid
for safety measures, not to mention the quanta limitation fixtures for sea level,
ground level, level off, and hover bearings.
We have retained as an added feature to stimulate more thrills,
the computer over-ride for a three and one half hours to two gens during
which pilots and co-pilots manually control free-fall, latitude,
longitude, protact gravity, revise dimensional equations,
run programme checks, submerge in the wild oceans of Jonrin 22,
to photograph as much territory as they can in addition
to the requisite three thousand automatic shots.
The postulate for mischance runs high but not as high as the tension
and competitive spirit right here on Earth and all over
the 4 galaxies represented in this Seventh Grande Trex.
Dragonfly rations glide
In free fall slide
System nullify
Satellite dragonfly
Surface launch
Radio silence
Hover high level off
The time space tactics saved us then
Display report present, urgent
Sequence counting surface launch
Dragonfly destroying all
Science claiming newest findings
Chanting calling flying dragons
Aboard all systems optimum
Nova scheduled war continued
Half the continental shelf burned by interval
Interval
Dragonfly Dragonfly
Beacons aim
Space game
Satellite computerized
Mighty flight
Hypersonic glide
The countdown is minus two hundred (-200)
and I am turning you over to the control room
at command central Sia Lan for the launch.
Good luck to all the racers and especially to our ship Dragonfly;
onward to victory.
(Remember comdirect and radio silence will temporarily be in effect.)
Win the race calibrate

End Of The Run	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/end_of_the_run-lyrics-102649.html	Def Dumb And Blonde	"Darkness falls like a black leather jacket and melts into the sidewalk like a sleeping drunk.
In the streets, the wind throws yesterday's headlines around.
Another night comes and goes.
So, for awhile back then there was someplace to go.
Somewhere more home than a house.
A family of choice, not an accident, but sometimes as soon as something gets started it's over.
Now the days are much shorter and the people from the good part of town all come around, but the something is missing even though there's more there now.
I shrug off my attempts to explain how a torn T-shirt made it all danger again.
I don't like flashbacks in movies.
I like the story to proceed.
I don't like talking about the old days except if it tells where the future will lead.
So we take a walk down this haunted hall or stumble through a shattered recall.
I know there's nothing to relive, it's just the shape of it all.
I don't want it different.
Don't want it again but value for value, now I'd never want it to end.
You think of the old friends and faces no more to be seen.
You think how much fun a line-up would mean.
And once that tape starts playing, it's too hard to make it rewind.
That one special face takes over your mind.
That end of the run.
We almost won.
The end of the run.
We had our fun.
The end of the run.
I knew it then.
It won't be back again.
We stood in the cold night, though we should be warm, in the back of the lot with me in your arms.
The sun was falling.
The grey rain was pouring.
The cars were all dirty and slow.
We both had our kiss and, out of the depths and darkness, with my eyes closed I still see you fine.
Cause that was the season we make our dreams come true.
There was no limit to what we could do.
The end of the run.
We almost won.
The end of the run.
We had our fun.
The end of the run.
I knew it then.
He won't be back again.
Once that tape starts playing it's too hard to make it rewind.
With my eyes closed I still see you fine.
That was the season we make our dreams come true.
There was no limit to what we could do.
The end of the run.
We almost won.
The end of the run.
We had our fun.
The end of the run.
I knew it then.
He won't be back again."
English Boys	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/english_boys-lyrics-102650.html	Blonde Beyond	"When I was 17
I saw a magazine
It had those English Boys
Who had long hair
When I was on my own
They moved into my town
And I just called 'em up
And they'd be there
In 1969
I had a lousy time
I listened to the songs
Read letters sent from Nam
Now peace and love were gone
The tired soldiers home
Ideal society
Gunned down the 70s
Does it feel the same to you?
Why do you act the way you do?
Pack it up or pack it in
There's no excuse
Could the hands of time reverse?
Would we wake or take the ride
And again speak with one voice?
We knew each other well
Although we never met
Messages passed to tell
Equal respect
Coincidence recurred
I had to laugh a lot
One week hung up superb
Said maybe not
Does it feel the same to you?
Why do you act the way you do?
Pack it up or pack it in
There's no excuse
Could the hands of time reverse?
Would we wake or take the ride
And again speak with one voice?"
Europa	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/europa-lyrics-102652.html	Autoamerican	"Based on the desire for total mobility and the serious physical pursuit
of religious freedom,
the auto drove mankind further than the wheel and,
in remote areas even today,
is forbidden as a device too suspect for human conveyance.
This articulate conception has only brought us all more of the same,
thoughtlessly locked into phase two gridlock, keyed up,
on it's rims and abandoned on the expressway"

Cracked for reason beyond recognition
Uh-huh
His space is
At the Palace, he sleeps for twenty five cents
Uh-huh
Now he's wiping headlights
Windshields with an old rag
It ain't nine to five
Down and dirty, he's an old tramp
He poses like a dead man
The night train passes by
Money's
Not the answer for princes and dancers
Uh-huh
He's standing under street lights
He's thinking of his old life
He lost his pretty young wife
The corner is his big plan
His brunch with Jim and jitters
Boston blue laws ain't for shitters
And newsprint is for cheaters
Cement mattress for believers
A dirty old bum
He's a dirty old bum
He can't say ""Yes""
He can't forget it A dirty old bum
Now he's shooting power curves
His buddies think he's got some nerve
Mrs Face had other lovers
Her arms smothered other numbers
He freezes
Christmas season, all saints protect him
Uh-huh
His face is
Cracked for reason beyond recognition

It drifted off the page
I sold my one vision for a piece of the cake
I haven't ate in days
For unspoken value, aesthetic and charm
I'd smile at you sideways
But the lighting is wrong, I'm taking a picture and counting the cost
While the bells in my ears keep ringing
I set my hand to writing you
It drifted of the page
I nearly fell, I feel like a lowlife in hell
And I haven't slept in days and days, days and days
Beat on my Fender through my Gemini 2
Play to the posters on the wall of my room
Thought I was crazy when I'd think about you
And the bells in my ears keep ringing
And the bells in my ears keep ringing
In my ear bells are ringing"

Hear the intention near me again.
Been to impatient and I'm ready to spill.

Taking me out of town.

And a trick up the sleeve
There's no use pretending

Quine geology
Deliberate notice
You're taking of me
Caution and danger
Are not family
Don't try turning the tables
On me!
Too long and too lonely
For your eyes only
Secretly
Enjoy the paradox
You thinking I'm the fox
Can't ya see

So many people know who you are
And they know how you've been looking
For your counterpart
We're chasing an echo
In sonic 3-D
If I laugh without joking
Make believe

And they spread their wings and soared through the ancient air.
And the beating of their wings made the winds.
And from the winds came the seas.
And from the sea came the life of the earth.
Nature's cast upon the sea the winds of past, of promise be.
Waters deep uncover me.
A scheme of sleep as lovers three.
If you'll forgive me my ferocity, I won't forget your sweetness.
Pull down the night, lay it before me.
Gratify my head with curses.
Night recalls tranquility.
A curtain falls and sets it free.
Darkness calls eternity.
Down silent halls the shadows flee.
If you'll forgive me my ferocity, I won't forget your sweetness.
Pull down the night, lay it before me.
Satisfy my head with curses.

How could I fall in love at zero gravity?
From a weightless condition to a heavy circumstance, like a voice with a vibrato do I tremble for the chance.
And will I hurt myself?
Am I like the man who fell?
And will I burn myself if I have to go through hell?
And if I did make you love me will you make me belong?
And I'm waiting for the time, like the calm before the storm.
Oh no you're not free to fall.
Free to fall!
Oh no you're not, not free to fall.
Oh no, oh no.
This must be someone else cause the part just isn't me.
Can this be happening cause it sounds like lines to me?
First you're sailing then you're swimming then you're sinking in the sea of love, still you sparkle and you sizzle cause a live wire always does.
Within the atmosphere so rare, so rare, so rare, I can see my liquid love light fading, fading, draining.
It's raining, raining.
And if I did make you love me, what did I do wrong?
And I'm waiting for the time, like the calm before the storm."

Get Your Way	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/get_your_way-lyrics-102674.html	Def Dumb And Blonde	"You make demands, you're out of hand and soon enough you're gonna get your way.
You rage and roar, you pace the floor and soon enough you're gonna have your day.
Get your way.
Got no time for temperament.
Bad attitude won't make a dent.
Don't cry baby, don't cry at all.
Got no need to take the fall.
Don't go on strike. You know what I like. You know how to love me, daddy - loose but tight.
Your mood is down, I'm losing ground and soon enough you're gonna have your day.
Get your way.
There's no need to stay at home alone.
No need for slamming the phone.
Got no need to kick the cat or get too high.
No need for that.
The silences when you don't speak - much worse than when you scolding me.
The silences when you won't speak - it's not the silence that's golden to me.
Look out!
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
I'm coming!
You make demands, you're out of hand and soon enough you're gonna get your way.
You rage and roar, you pace the floor and soon enough your gonna get your way.
Don't go on strike. You know what I like. You know how to love me, daddy - loose but tight.
Your mood is down, I'm losing ground and soon enough you're gonna have your day.
Get your way.
You know I always get my way.
I'm hot!
I do succeed.
Like Washington at Valley Forge, I get just what I need.
Like Iron Mike with a TKO and Jesse James with a .44, I keep on coming moving slow and put them on the floor.
Get up!
Turn it up a bit.
Get up!
Turn it up a bit.
I'm self contained.
I use my brain and I keep the people entertained.
It's a long way up with no elevator, but I'm gonna get there sooner or later cuz the last thing that I'm gonna do is not do what I wanted to.
Get up!
Turn it up a bit.
Get up!
Turn it up a bit.
Like Frankenstein and Danger Mouse I'm gonna make some noise and rock the house!
You have been demanding. Throwing temper tantrums. Soon enough your gonna get your way.
You have been highhanded. Setting super standards. Soon enough you're gonna get your way.
You have been vindictive. You can go and stick it. Pretty soon you're gonna get your way.
Don't you go on strike. You know just what I like now. Pretty soon you're gonna have your day.
Get your way.
You're so dramatic, you're too emphatic, but soon enough you're gonna get your way.
We've been conflicting. You'd better start thinking and pretty soon you're gonna get your way.
Don't go on strike. You know what I like. You know how to love me, daddy - loose but tight.
Your mood is down. I'm losing ground and soon enough you're gonna have your day.
Get your way.
You make demands, you're out of hand and soon enough you're gonna get your way.
You rage and roar, you pace the floor and soon enough you're gonna get your way.
Your mood is down. I'm losing ground and soon enough you're gonna get your way.
You're so dramatic. You're too emphatic, but soon enough you're gonna get your way.
Have your day.
Get your way.
You have your day. Yeah, you get what you want. Uh huh.
Get your way. Have your day.
Soon enough you're gonna get it, yeah.
You're gonna get your way.
Have your day. Get your way. Uh huh. Uh huh.
Don't go on strike. You know what I like."
Go Through It	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/go_through_it-lyrics-102675.html	Autoamerican	"She knew it about Route Three
Oh, she blew it, you know she could've told me
He can't say no, he can't ask why
Go through it, highway bride
He delivers, he's a roadsider
He gets no road from a back seat driver
Away we go, yes or no?
I love you honey, gimme a beer
But just like Jerry Lee, she's tuning in on me
And I've got no defence, but it makes no difference
'Cause just like Jerry Lee, she's tuning in on me
She does it easy, like a CB
He's hard to hold on the rolling road
He knows his rig's hot, get through that roadblock
Ten miles to go, oh, radio
She knew it, now so does he
Ah, I love you honey, gimme a beer
Ooh, go through it, come sit right here"

I know he's there, but I just had to call.
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.
I heard your mother, now she's going out the door.
Did she go to work or just go to the store?
All those things she said, I told you to ignore.
Oh why can't we talk again?
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.
It's good to hear your voice, you know it's been so long.
If I don't get your calls then everything goes wrong.
I want to tell you something you've known all along.
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.
I had to interrupt and stop this conversation.
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation.
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection.
Oh I can't control myself!
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone.
Hang up and run to me! Oh!"

Heart Of Glass	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/heart_of_glass-lyrics-102686.html	The Best Of Blondie	"Once I had a love and it was a gas
Soon turned out had a heart of glass

It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind

In your dreams you were dancing.

I make believe you're with me and I don't look back.

Fade away like a word on a stone.
You won't fly, you won't fly, you won't fall.

Is that really your reflection in there?
I just want to jump into the warm depths and be there with you, one more time!
Oh, alright
Hit it boys
My initials sprayed across a pavement
Cut into your private interview
Talk to me now, step into my room
We'll have a word or two
If I ever had a million dollars
And if I didn't give it all to you
Would you lose interest?
Show me indifference?
Foot in another shoe?
Not very high heels
Not wearing sneakers too
A magazine ad, a printed canvas
A basic new shade blue suede shoe
Thought I'd like to have a little party
Thought I'd like to have a little do
Sure I stopped drinking but for the moment
Honey, here's looking at you
I'll stop my drinking, give you my promise true
Clean out the closet, be existential
And cast a vote for the president too
But for the action of the moment
Nothing does what it ought to do
Instant depression, I learned my lesson
Nothing that I'd rather do
Come on over my place
Can't see him sideways
Honey, here's looking at you
Oh"

You better cut me loose or hand me a noose

I wanna move like what's his name.
I'll keep the money, you can have the fame.
Everything that's yours will soon be mine.

Made up my mind and I made my plans.
I'm onto you like a hardcore fan.
I got trackers and lookouts, electronic scanners.
Got you on my mind and it's mind over manners.
I've got the inside news.
I've got the latest point of view.
I'm looking to pursue any stories that I hear of you.

Got no time for poses.
Set my explosives.
I'm gunning for you, I got power packed motives."

Two weeks ago saturday I was on TV.
I'd like a show of my own.
But you see I'm still on E even though everything is happening to me.
So when your drivin' on home don't regret your loan.
I'm on E.
I'm on E.
I gave my car to a guy named Vinnie.
I feel like gassin' my feet.
They've totalled (?) and skipped a beat.
I used to have a car of my own.
28 or 58.
Walking to refrigerator.
To the pump, do the bump.
Still on E, I'll think of something.
I'm on E and I'm on E.
I'll never have to stop my feet.
28 or 58.
Walking to refrigerator.

Imitation Of A Kiss	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/imitation_of_a_kiss-lyrics-102717.html	The Jazz Passengers: Individually Twisted	"This is an imitation of a kiss.
An imitation's all it is and when I kiss you, it may look like a kiss.
Call it a kiss, this imitation of love.
It's an imitation of romance.
All hollow gestures and demands.
You get agressive.
So tired of routines, you go to extremes.
This imitation of romance.
There's a place I used to go, it's closed down long ago.
I'd lie down there in your darkness watching rivers flow.
Now it's an imitation of love.
No one's fooling no one.
And though you're here now, I'm so far away.
Let's call it a day.
This imitation of a kiss.
When it looks like all is lost here something reappears.
All my reasons leave the room now, leaving you still here.
This is an imitation of goodbye.
I say it's over all the time, yet I'm still with you.
Don't know why it is I can't resist this imitation of a kiss."

Remembering your love is nothing without you in the flesh.

Met you with a girlfriend. You were so divine!
She said,  Hands off this one sweetie, this boy is mine.
I couldn't resist you - I'm not deaf, dumb, and blind.
Darlin' darlin' darlin', now you're out of town.
Those girls that you run with, they bring my head down.

Inner City Spillover	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/inner_city_spillover-lyrics-102724.html	Koo Koo	"Lying in her bed a brick fell on her head.
Plaster finally crumbled and dropped it's load.
Oh oh.
Now the building was condemned.
Recycled, used again.
The brick that smashed her brain is now a road in Maine.
When the pressure is way way down, the water comes out brown.
It was on television they took her brain uptown.
Fearing (peace?) would poison her, some abstract modern saint.
A painting or a sculpture or a cultural restraint.
Inner City Spillover.
Where the big time ticks.
Royal Rose's ovens, have to warm, what the furnace skips.
Inner City Spillover.
Pop the scene.
Inner City Spillover.
Isle of dreams.
Inner City Spillover.
Workmen on the beam.
Lying on her bed a brick fell on her head.
You find the ace of hearts and win.
It's easy man!
At a higher school of knowledge, they put her brain in college.
Replacement parts and slippery cards will come around again.
The writings on the wall.
Statesmen say it all.
With the art wars on and the colors crash long long before the fall.
One out of these three cards will definitely up the odds.
Find the red heart, red to win.
Drop on in.
Time out and time in all the suckers play it again by the Broadway Babies and the island men and the hotshots gamblin'.
Inner City Spillover.
Pops and picks.
Inner City Spillover.
Where the big time ticks.
Inner City Spillover.
Isle of dreams.
Inner City Spillover.
Workmen on the beam.
Inner City Spillover.
Subway riders fight.
Newsmen uncover more horrors to describe.
Ok sweetheart, pull over, where'd you learn to drive?.
Angels eye the people over, ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai!.
Inner City Spillover.
Where the big time ticks.
Royal Rose's ovens, have to warm, what the furnace skips.

Pop the scene.

So if you're out and get caught in the rain, just give a smile, cast your line out again.
When you are down keep on going.
Determination will change your luck.
Don't look around, no, keep on going.
If you believe that you've had enough then you must keep on going.

Something, something tells me constantly.
Oh I'll never be the object of all men's eyes.
Or win no beauty prize.
It's me, and me alone he can see.
He likes to stay home in the evening.
Most people tell me he's rare.
As long as he loves me, I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.
I mean what I say when I say it...
Don't catch me chasing round at night.I'm not impressed by glamorous sights, no no no.
L'il darlin' is obvious pretty.
So many guys you may see.
But my little darlin' only loves me.
My little darlin' only loves me.
My little darlin' only loves me.
He loves only me."
Lip Service	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/lip_service-lyrics-102752.html	Debravation	"I can tell you've got it bottled up inside.
I can tell 'cause it shows in your eyes.
You keep on keeping your secrets inside and I, I will tell you, tell you no lies.
That's my lip service, lip service.
I can tell you heard a lot of this before.
I can tell you've had your fill.
You, you keep yours, and I, I'll keep mine and when we tell stories we'll wait for bedtime.
But the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling, straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door;
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking, fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore.
Said the Raven, ""Nevermore.""
Your lips are sealed, but your eyes reveal the reason you tell me, the reason you squeal for my lip service, lip service."

Friends call me LC

Who wants to be your friend
I'll make you a happy ending

I've been called alotta names
Some of them obscene
But you think I'm funny
And wonder about me
I don't worry anymore
Get uptight or fear
Back in the days of funny funny
They called me queer
They used to call me
They called me rudely
I'm a love 'em and leave 'em kinda fella
A good time gentlemen
Perform my magic for ya
Then I'll make my plan
When I'm gone you'll feel so low
Obsession outta hand
You'll find I'll linger in your mind
You can't forgive me
You won't forget me
You can't live without me
Can't live without me
You'll find there's not enough
And that you love too much
Can't live with me
You can't live with me
Can't live without me
Just call me Caesar
You can't forgive me
You won't forget me
I'm Little Caesar yeah"

Live It Up	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/live_it_up-lyrics-102759.html	Autoamerican	"Your old lover's lying in the gutter
He used to be such an all night strutter
""Oh, my heart,"" I heard him mutter
""Oh, my dear, it seems to flutter""
Ah, ah
It's so hard to say ""No""
When the deck is stacked to only go slow
It's easy sweet to live it up
An easy street when you've had enough
Ah, ah
Darkened night, splashing light
Soft and white and so polite
Let him in, beneath the rim
Beneath the skin, your next of kin
Cleansing fire, funeral pyre
Broken wire grown inside her
Secret hush, swollen rush
It's soft and plush, it's so plush
You know it's so passe
To sleep without you every day
So easy to do your stuff
So easy to live it up
Ah, ah"

I talk to me, I even agree.
Every day's a holiday.
You can look through the glass and take a photograph.
You will never ever walk on the moon, leave your body and float through the room.
You could never conquer me, 'cause I'm not here and you're not there.
And, and I'm not living in the real world.
I'm not living in the real world.
I'm not living in the real world, no more, no more.
Yeah.
Didn't I ever tell you I was gone?
Didn't I ever tell you I was gone?
Bye bye!
I can do anything at all.
I'm invisible and I'm twenty feet tall.
Pull the plug on your digital clock and it all goes dark and the bodies stop.
Hey, I'm living in a magazine, page to page in my teenage dream.
Hey, now, Mary, you can't follow me, without a satellite.
I'm on a power flight 'cause I'm not living in the real world.

Steal away inside you.

Throw your weight on me baby
Don't complain on me baby

Love At The Pier	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/love_at_the_pier-lyrics-102764.html	Plastic Letters	"We fell in love down at the pier
You were sunbathing, I was around
Soon we were sharing a beer
We fell in love at the pier
I'm no sentimental slob so don't think I'm queer
You got something baby and it ain't just my beer
Well, maybe it's the hot pants, maybe the heat
Or was it the sneakers you kicked of your feet?
I sat under my umbrella to keep my pearly skin
You tanned your oily body looking like sin
Well, soon I was sweating and I wanted to leave
You slipped into the water from too much grease
Well, I saw you yelling. I just couldn't hear
So I screamed back at you ""Honey keep the beer!""
We never consummated our outside love affair
Too much tar and water, too much hot air
Oh, what a tragic end to love that was lost
We would have stood a chance if we met in the frost, but
We fell in love down at pier
You were sunbathing, I was around
Now I go to beaches with my girlfriend
No more love splinters in my rear end"
Lovelight	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/lovelight-lyrics-102765.html	Def Dumb And Blonde	"I see my lovelight coming after me.
It lights the darkness so I can see.
Like a river of fire, or a lake of gold, heats my desire when I get cold.
Oh, cut the cord of love's reward.
The seven sisters and the seven sons at the gates of heaven when day is done, but the seven sisters all have sinned and old Saint Peter won't let them in.
Come drink the cup that fills me up.
Up is down.
Squares are round.
A straight line always bends.
Wrong is right and black is white.
Beginnings are all ends.
Like a wall of fire and a sea of blood, I'll climb the mountain and escape the flood.
I see my lovelight coming after me.
It breaks the dark night so I can see.
When lies are torn, we hear the horn beyond the pale of love's prevail.
I see my lovelight coming after me."

With what I know, he never stood a chance!

He gave it all for love.
Said, lower the boats, he's sinking in a sea of love.
Lower the boats, he's sinking in a sea of love.
Yeah, I've been sailing the sea of love, experiencing romance...
With what I know, he never stood a chance.

Ooh, wanna make her all your own?
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Regina, Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
I've seen this thing before
In my best friend and the boy next door
Fool for love and fool on fire
Won't come in from the rain
She's oceans running down the drain
Blue as ice and desire
Don't you wanna make her?
Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?
Maria, you've gotta see her
Go insane and out of your mind
Regina, Ave Maria
A million and one candle lights
Ooh, don't you wanna break her?
Ooh, don't you wanna take her home?
She walks like she don't care
Walkin' on imported air
Ooh, it makes you wanna die

Baby, take a little more.
Baby, come along.
Not for ever and a day.
Not for evermore.
Not for always.
Not that way.
Maybe just for sure.
It's like walking on little feet, one small step at a time.
Just like when we learn to speak.
Small words do just fine.
Not for ever and a day.
Not for evermore.
Not for always.
Not that way.
Maybe just for sure.
You know, I've been as honest with you as I've been true to myself.
Counting my fingers, one of every kind.
I'm taking inventory, making sure what's mine, and when I look for someone to count on I take my time.
Baby, when we speak of love and promises to keep, when it comes to push or shove vows can fall asleep.
Not for ever and a day.
Not for evermore.
Not for always.
Not that way.
Maybe just for sure.
Now you know exactly how I feel about making promises I can't keep and about saying the small words ""I love you""."

Watch while my mind starts to go...
Maybe I dribble a little.
Maybe I'm lost...
I only put up a front.
Losing the fear for the hunt.
Address me as Madame Kluseau!
People all tell me to go, to go, and jump off a bridge!
Where's my house?
Maybe it's time to relax.
Sell insurance and pack up your sax.
Buy a chateau au sud de la Bronx.
Maybe they're right.
They say I should bolt.
Take a train on the fifth of July.
I'll pack some apples and eau de cologne.
Maybe I'll try, I'll try, I'll try and blow up a bridge!
I'd be staring at tugboats in June
And what is the name of this tune?
Turning tricks on the boat to Calais.
I'd be Queen for a day.
Then I'd settle for luck.
Daily Double at old Aqueduct.
I'd fill my pockets with sheckles and juice.
Put my winnings to use.
And go, and go, and blow up a bridge!
Where's my house?
What's my name?
Where am I?
Who are you?"

I can't hear you!
Pick em up and put em down.
You're in the army now.
We'll make a man of you and then a soldier too.
Shoulders back and stomach in.
We'll teach you discipline.
Mother's sons and father's daughters - shut it up and follow orders.
Study up on weaponry.
The M-16, the M-15.
Sammy knows the enemy.
Flim flam big slam tell the major what you see.
Hut hut hut hut!
Ayattolah rock the house.
(?) with Minnie Mouse.
Donald Duck is going red.
Goofy's working for the feds.
8 ball in the side pocket.
I just shot my last rocket!
I'm coming back!
They're on my tail!
Aren't you glad I escaped from jail?
Bangkok rocks!
Bangkok rocks!
Girls on the strip.
It's a one way trip.
Bangkok rocks!
Patpong, Patpong, Patpong.
Bangkok rocks!
Soldiers dine for free.
Nato's up a tree.
Tours at 9 and 3!
Go now, pray later.
It's a lay-away plan!
Free vacation in Iran!
Stop and see the middle east.
Miles and miles of lovely beach.
Get that Coppertone tan on radioactive sand.
Those at home just got a directive.
All report to the neighborhood collective.
10 hours a day making makeup so the girls at the front can be more attractive.
If I die on the Russian front, bury me with Russian mud.
If they drop us in the East, (?)."

Where does it end?
Where's the division in ocean and sand?
Days are quiet, nights are long.
Everything is August, everything is calm.
We're lying here in the heat in suspended animation with a slo-mo beat.
Taken together, taken apart, I feel your excitement.
Take it to heart.
Changes of season, changes of reason, but changes in a mood ring come straight from the heart.
Where does it stand?
Where does it bend?
Where does my love light begin and yours end?
Days are quiet, nights are long.
Everything is August, everything is calm.
We're lying here in the groove in the heat equation.
We don't wanna move.
Light as a feather.
Light in the dark.

Changes of season, changes of reason, but changes in a mood ring come straight from the heart."

This will be my last date with you

Its as plain as can be, I can see, I can see
This will be my last date with you

Messenger of sympathies, my heart beats loud in exstacy.
When your shadow falls on me, a sillouette; reality.
And I chase every night after you.
And I chase after you.
Of all your loaded mysteries, the color of your sympathies,
my words cannot express your awful loveliness.
So come with me through smoke and mirrors.
We'll bring our differences nearer.
We'll float upon an inland sea.
Embody visions of a dream.
And I chase every night after you.
I got a chill, and the night wind sent me a chill.
And the night wind sent me a chill.
You wander through my sleeping mind, reading thoughts I've left behind.
I always know when you've been there.
Tangles of perfume fill my hair.
Your music, by the night wind sent, awakes my quiet instrument.
In the silence of your steps, I can see into the depths."

Get the girls and get their sisters.
Pinch em up and give em blisters.
Kiss em fierce with all his might, forever.

It said ""Wait, hold up homie!
You must be trippin!
You can't be putting that simpin and whimpin up in your pippin!
You better stand tall, fool you was born to ball.
Took a little fall and now you wanna end it all!
You've been chasing dreams like a hound dog on the hunt.
Take your place in the front.
Put your hand on the pump.
And it's right in your grasp, man.
I know they're laughing, but you'll be laughing later cuz time's are gonna get greater.
You's a player, and when I say player I mean player cuz your daddy and your uncle was a player.
Who's gonna cry for ya?
Who's gonna cry over you?
Who's gonna cry for ya?
Who's gonna cry over you?
Put yourself in your position.
You ain't wishin for no food and no warmth and no light, so you must be doing all right.
But wait a minute!
Something's wrong.
It's lunatic, it's mad, insane!
Busted like a water main.
Indulgence in another vein.
What they're saying round the neighborhood is what he's drinking's not aged in wood.
He's filling out.
He's all growed up.
He's all blowed up.
He's gotten fat.
He's filling out.
He's all growed up.
He's all blowed up.
He's gotten fat.
Sure enough at the midnight lounge there's a dent in the seat where the vampire sat.
Bye bye to another life.
Bye bye to another life.
Living dead is doing time, like drowning on the circle line.
Who's gonna cry for ya?
Who's gonna cry over you?
Who's gonna cry for ya?
Who's gonna cry over you?
Who's gonna cry over you?
Cry over you?
Tell me would they lie for you?
Die for you?
You're hoping that it's true for you do for you, fool.
But who's gonna cry?"

Slowly down the staircase, looking for the door
All is fair in love and war but I don't want your love no more

Nothing is real but the girl.
Nothing is real but her.
Money goes to money in a figure eight around me.
Money.
Who's gonna love me if I liquidate and drown me?
Nothing is real but the girl.
Nothing else feels solid.
We believe in love.
We believe in little things like Heaven up above and seven.
It's a lucky number!
We believe that something lives inside every thing there is.
Don't think about it much.
I mean it.
I believe it.
I believe it.
Wind down.
Put your mind down like your missing school.
You'll teach her to find out while your dying in your living room how much you need her.
Nothing is real but the girl.
Only her eyes are solid.
Nothing is real but her.
Nothing is real but the girl."
Now I Know You Know	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/now_i_know_you_know-lyrics-102782.html	Koo Koo	"Now I know you know I tried to love you so and now I have to go.
You sound so inspiring when you pledged your support, but I've learned how to read right between the lines and see into your thoughts.
The game that you're playing - you know you almost had a win, but I had a hunch of my own, you see, and followed it to the end.
Now I don't have hard feelings against you.
You only did what you had to do.
But the time has come to let you know I know about the loving show.
Now I know you know how I tried to love you so and now I have to go.
I've said that my music will play second love to none, but you haven't learned to love yourself, you had to be the only one.
The way that I feel, I really want you to succeed, so I don't understand why you simply can't recognize my needs.
Well, I don't have hard feelings against you.
I guess you only did what you had to do, but the time has come to let you know I know about the loving show.
Now I know you know how I tried to love you so and now I have to go.
Now I know you know how I tried to love you so and now I have to go.
I got a right to live and be in love with music, so fancy free"

One two one two three.
Hey oh.
Hey oh.
Hey, wake up Cinderella... it's 11:59!
No time to count your slippers and it's back to 9 to 5.
You're a prisoner of Monday.
You've got Friday on your mind.
You're gonna fly right out your window!
I'm not going for the ride.
Don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me no more, hey!
Don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me.
Don't count on me.
Don't count on me.
Hey, I don't play with numbers and I don't step on the lines.
And accidents won't happen cuz I'm a lucky guy.
And I fall in love with love again when I look into your eyes.
Can't be for real.
I would like a wheel. If I wanna driver. I'm feeling. (?)
Bye bye.
Don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me no more, hey!
Don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me.
Don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me like that, no!
Don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me.
Don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me.
She don't want a lover like another easy number, like another cigarette.
She counts us in, she holds again. (?)
She's looking good in blue again.
Now I don't live on the numbers, on the colors that you fly above you.
The safety in the numbers.
On the covers in your bed I said I love you but don't count on me.
Don't count on me, don't count on me like that, no!
Don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me like that, no!
Don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me.
Don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me, don't count on me.
Don't count on me me me me me like that like that no no no.
Don't count on me me me me me no no no no.

Oasis	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/oasis-lyrics-102784.html	Koo Koo	"How many times have you heard, how many times did you say
""I think I'm going crazy! You're driving me out of my mind!""?
We know it's just an expression, a silly little phrase.
Not the doorbell, not a bird call .
Koo Koo.
How do you drive someone crazy?
To where?
In what kind of car?
Maybe we find a road map.
I'm sure it's not very far.
We know it's not so serious.
We take it all in fun.
Answer the ding dong, do you play ping pong?
Could you?
Trying to get your attention.
Did someone say earth's calling you?
Don't say it, don't ever mention, you're hearing more voices than two.
Roasted or raw delicious!
Freeze dried or salted divine!
Was that a...
Are you a...
are you?
Storms have rearranged the sand millions of years up til now.
Crusaders on a never ending search die for a never ending thirst.
What a fine perforformance, oasis!
Well worth the standing ovation.
Not a mirage.
Not camoflouge to you."
Ole	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/ole-lyrics-102785.html	The Jazz Passengers: Individually Twisted	"Here's an idea that I have been brewing.
We all feel like ruins, so whatta ya say?
I've got these four wheels and who could want for more wheels?
Just throw in a suitcase.
We're off and away.
Let's drive south, way past the border, raise our passports high there.
Mexico will light our load.
Our spirits, they will fly there.
Don't say ""Oh haha"" 'til you feel the Baja.
The people are kind there, I know you will agree.
Frida Carlo and Katie Gerado are two of my favorites.
They always have been.
Come with me to Guadalejara.
Stop off at Chiuaua.
Tiny dogs will greet us there.
We'll sit and yap for hours.
I'm just a vulture for old Mayan culture, or reefs you can snorkle.
No bullfights for me.
Late in the morning, we'll catch a fiesta in time for siesta again.
Vera Cruz will ease our blues then off up to Durango.
I'm really partial to shellfish and mangoes and fresh cut celantro.
I know that you can go!
We'll try the Flamenco.
Hey senor, don't be a bore.
This sadness you're bearing, it's wearing you down.
When you unravel, there's nothing like travel so pick up the pieces.
Take it from me.
All at once, your life is over for your very eyes.
So whatta ya say?
I say ole.
Ole.
Que padre?
Ole!
I say ole ole ole ole ole ole ole.
I say ole."

Very near and then you vanish
Rescue from invasion
Narrowly avoided
Have to live with nature
Hear a voice from a novel
Love persuasion
Very near and then you vanished
Some say he's too handsome
Some say he's unique
Steel the weave the night trick
Aphrodisiac
Ah oo ah the boy's herb
Vanilla vanilla
They say I'll never find him
Or evidence left behind
Flip a coin to decide it
Is it now or never?
Have to live with nature
I hear the voice from a novel
Love persuasion
Oh Orchidia
Steel the weave the night trick
Weave the tale you find
Reappear in a vision
My heart's racing with the rhythm
Even in the drum beat
Time will tell the story
Looking for an adventure
Here today gone tomorrow
Articles declaring
Evidence to follow
Heart is pumping to the rhythm
The story is repeated

Where are ya? Where are ya?
Oh Orchidia
Where are you, Oh Orchidia?

He don't do the wild things that he did before.

He used to act bad.
Used to, but he quit it.
It makes me so sad, 'cause I know that he did it for me (and I can see) and I can see (still in the street) his heart, his heart is out in the street.
He don't comb his hair like he did before.
He don't wear those dirty old black boots no more.
(Ooh)
But he's not the same.
There's something 'bout his kisses... that tells me he's changed.
I know there's something missing inside.
(Tell me more)
Something died.
(Still in the street)
His heart, his heart is out in the streets.
He grew up on the sidewalk, streetlights shining above.
He grew up with no one to love.
He grew up on the sidewalk, he grew up running free.
He grew up and then he met me.
He don't hang around with the gang no more.
Gee, he doesn't smile like he did before.
(Ooh)
I wish I didn't care.
I wish I'd never met him.
They're waiting out there, so I got to set him free.
(Send him back)
He's gotta be...

His heart, his heart is out in the street.
He don't hang around with the gang no more.

Rain rain go away, come again some other day.
Baby baby, unchain my heart!
Unchain my soul.
Let the sunshine back into my life.
Bring it on, let it roll.
Make the wind blow the clouds away, hey.
All I want is inspiration.
Let the voices within me speak.
But for now it's only rainy, rainy, rainy December.
I've had enough of this rain crying for my pain.
Let in some light again.
Make the day night again.
It's raining in my heart.
The sky is always dark.
The calm before the storm.
There was no time to warn.
Got to keep brewing on.
The water's coming in, into my heart before there was time to warn you.
I can't give up my reason, I love the change in season."

[Blondie]
THERE'S NO sinning, bears getting dressed to kill
Laughing down the sun like a jackal will
With his eyes ablaze and his lips apart
He's gonna fill his cup with the love in your heart
And drink it up till the morning starts
Circulate the red light this is get the girls and get the sis'
Pinch him up and give em bliss
Kissin fears with all his might forever
[Coolio]
Standed on the verge of the edge of the ledge
Waitin for me to fall, then I got a call
It said,  WAIT HOLD UP HOMEY, YOU MUST BE TRIPPIN
YOU CAN'T BE PUTTIN THAT STRIPPIN AND WHIPPIN
UP IN YOUR PIMPIN, YOU BETTER STAND TALL
FOOL YOU WAS BORN TO BALL
TOOK A LITTLE FALL AND NOW YOU WANNA END IT ALL
YOU BEEN CHASIN DREAMS LIKE A HOUND DOG ON THE HUNT
Take your place in the front wit yo' hands on the blunt
And it's right in your grasp man, I know they laughin
BUT YOU'LL BE LAUGHIN LATER CUZ TIMES IS GON' GET GREATER!
[Blondie]
That's when you least expect it
You understand there is no exit
[Prodigy]
Aiyyo rock that *shit*, slamdance to this
Move the *fuck* back when you see us in the mosh pit
Smash something when my heavy metal raps thump in
Crack more heads open than Beck's, you and your mans floated
Tales From The Crypt, Rocky Horror couldn't Picture it
Spine-tingling, give you goose bumps singin it
*Bitch-ass niggas* scared to party wit The Infamous
We jumpin over the bar snatchin mad liquors
[U-God]
Out of the darkness, spark this total chaos
Mark to scheme the hardest, nothing can save us
All that is sacred, dearly departed
Braveheart slave brave contains something courageous
Salute shining armor, persona rip stages
Loud as Nirvana, beneath the golden ages
The road rash explode, little rigor that devour
Don't cry for me, I'm bout drunk off the power
Chorus [Blondie] 2x
Who's gonna cry for ya
Who's gonna cry over you
[Havoc]
Now if you think my Infamous Mobb remains untamed
And we out for the cash while you out for the fame
Lay back, count on my stack down to Cognac
Writin my raps, here hold that, it's bound to go plat
When my bang hits, relentless, whatever I spit
Like a fresh pair of kicks outta the box, ready to rock
You know the drilly stay collaboratin wit my committee
Then it's on the L-I-E to QB city
[Inspectah Deck]
Yo yo
We storm the sound clash, but none heard the sound of the blast
Send the mass outta control, the system found smash
There's blood on the dance floor, they still chant  More!
The nitty gritty, New York inner city
Fifty caliber thoughts force the world to bang wit me
Bound to hit hard like twenty gods benchin in the yard
Men at large take charge, out to make ours and take ours
We fought against all odds
Party crasher, verbal assault, quick to blast ya
Ya stunned momentarily, dropped seconds after
Chorus 2x
*guitar solo*
Chorus to end"
Rapture (K-klassic Mix)	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/rapture_kklassic_mix-lyrics-102815.html	The Best Of Blondie	"Toe to toe, dancing very close.
Body breathing almost comatose.
Wall to wall, people hypnotized.
And they're stepping lightly.
Hang each night, in rapture.
In rapture.
Back to back, sacroiliac.
Spineless movement and a wild attack.
Face to face, sightless solitude.
And it's finger popping.
Twenty four hour shopping in rapture.
Fab Five Freddy told me everybody's fly.
D.J. spinning, I said, ""My, My.""
Flash is fast, flash is cool.
Francois, c'est pas flashe non due.
And you don't stop, sure shot.
Go out to the parking lot.
And you get in your car and drive real far.
And you drive all night and then you see a light.
And it comes right down and it lands on the ground.
And out comes the man from Mars.
And you try to run but he's got a gun.
And he shoots you dead and he eats your head.
And then you're in the man from Mars.
You go out at night eating cars.
You eat Cadillacs, Lincolns too.
Mercurys and Subaru.
And you don't stop.
You keep on eating cars.
Then when there's no more cars you go out at night
And eat up bars where the people meet.
Face to face.
Dance cheek to cheek.
One to one.
Man to man.
Dance toe to toe.
Don't move too slow 'cause the man from Mars is through with cars.
He's eating bars.
Yeah, wall to wall.
Door to door.
Hall to hall.
He's gonna eat 'em all.
Rapture.
Be pure.
Man to man, body muscular.
Sismic decibel by the jugular.
Wall to wall tea time technology and a digital ladder.
No sign of bad luck in rapture.
In rapture.
In rapture."

Rifle Range	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/rifle_range-lyrics-102822.html	Blondie	"I was all alone with the scent of a bone and my heart was stuck in this emptiness zone.
I had not a care, though I wanted to hear the voice of a maiden who was playing down there...
At the rifle range, I lost my heart.
At the rifle range, I could not start.
At the rifle range, she left me so hot!
At the rifle range.
Like a victim of truce I was strung on a noose cracking at the news of a prey let loose.
I turned around to stare at the face she would wear and I ran through the gallows, her heart was down there.
At the rifle range, I lost my heart.
At the rifle range, I could not start.
At the rifle range, I heard a shot!
At the rifle range.
If I lose my head, we'll be certainly dead, with visions of acid, how I wish they bled.
The drummings of fear cause they're getting so near and I think of a lion who was devoured down there.
Yeah yeah yeah! At the rifle range, I lost my heart.
At the rifle range, I could not start.
At the rifle range, I heard a shot.
At the rifle range, she left me so hot!
At the rifle range, Bang bang!
At the rifle range, Bang bang!
At the rifle range, Bang bang!"

I can't escape the sound of it - the sound of my screaming skin.

My blood sighs.
I still owe some dread on this hide.
Following my trust in wonder I watch the circus begin.
I can't ignore the scent of it - the scent of my screaming skin.
My skin cries.
My blood sighs.
I still owe some dread on this hide.
La la la la la la la.
La.
La la la la la la la.
I'm a multicellular individual.
You're way out of proportion!
We've got the hemodynamic connection.
Don't call me germ!
Allowing for my strength to muster.
My losses begin to win.
Tropical winds start to bluster, raising the fur on my skin.
My skin cries.
My spirits fly.
But I still owe some dread on this hide.
Oooh.
Yeah!
I'm a multicellular individual.
You're way out of proportion!
We've got the hemodynamic connection.
And don't call me germ!
Swallowing my pride no longer, I take the forbidden sun.
If I have been sculpted by hunger, I'm not the only one.
My skin cries.
My blood sighs.
I still owe some dread on this hide of mine.
La la la la la la la.

Secret Life	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/secret_life-lyrics-102837.html	Rockbird	"Listen while I tell of a secret life, clandestine lives entwined like vines.
You may already know where when and how.
If I tell ya then, it's no secret now.
Two sides to every story.
Heads and tails of the very same coin.
Two sides to every story.
Different words with identical rhyme.
They appear to be most commonplace.
They're breathing like the winners of a marathon race.
It's blase casuality...
They are balanced like a trinity.
Two sides to every story.
Opposites from the ends of the earth.
Two sides to every story.
Who's to say what either is worth.
We come together, our story's told as one.
We come together, after all is said and done.
Listen while I tell of a secret life, lives entwined like vines, man and wife.
They said it all, express solidarity...
When one's a crowd, three's company.
We come together, our story's told as one.
We come together, after all is said and done.
We come together, our story's told as one.
We come together, still the same two parallel lines."
Shayla	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/shayla-lyrics-102838.html	Blonde Beyond	"Shayla worked in a factory.
She wasn't history.
She's just a number.
One day she gets her final pay and she goes far away.
Green trees call to me.
I am free but life is so cheap.
Scenery is still outside of me.
All alone, trapped by its beauty.
Shayla turned to run away, to leave in peace and end her stay.
Years of fear were in her way.
Lost in space and down she came.
Suddenly some subtle entity, some cosmic energy, brushed her like shadows.
Down here we stop to wonder.
Cars on the freeway.
Bright lights and thunder."

Pick up the beat, you can move like you're made out of vapor.
Catch me if you can  is what she said with her hands.
Come on and take me back.
Can you take her back?
When she gives you the beat and you get the shine, the world slows down and she stops on a dime.

She can put you up on a shelf until she wants to pull the string.
Still you know she'll never slip away.

I can keep today but tomorrow's fine.

I want to go, I want to go, I want to go down to go to sleep.
Your frame of reference is my swimming pool.
My, my swimming pool still looks like the China Sea.
Pool to sea and finally the sound-a-sleep.
Feel the muscles in your face twitch, relax, remembering everything that went down and will go down.
I want to go down to sleep.

Stability	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/stability-lyrics-102847.html	Debravation	"Hey, I don't feel so good lately.
I wake up with the thought of you penetrating my head.
Instead, I wanna fill my bed with thoughts of us joined at the heart like we were at the start.
You left me talking to myself, underneath the weather.
No good-bye kiss or long love letter.
Don't orchestrate my life, just be-bop.
Must I take pills for stability?
With you I can hardly speak.
Must I confess to the stress that I feel?
(Yes, you must.)
You take me right to the edge.
You take me right to the edge.
I need some more of your time.
I'm not trying to be funny!
If you think I'm a joke you got another thing coming.
When your orders came by phone today... I'm not alone.
I heard you, but what did you say?
So now you're talking to yourself.
Do ya like it?
Well, do you like it any better?
Don't orchestrate my life, just be-bop.
If you are so sophisticated, why am I still denigrated when I should be venerated?
I'm sick and tired of repudiation where upon your orchestration leads to endless complication and causes me great consternation.
Cha cha cha!
You love to dance, but you maintain you're not romantic.
Bla bla bla!
You love to talk, but I'm still out here stranded.
La la la!
You love to sing, but don't you know a different key?
Ha ha ha!
If I'm your last laugh, are you sure the joke's on me?
You don't have to ""hubby love"" me.
Don't try to chubby shove me.
You don't have to tell me I'm your ultimate honey.
Medicinal value, na na natural cure, don't analyze the 98% pure.
Value for value with no medicinal taste.
He should had a license for that thing below his waist.
Don't ya know the leash laws?
Sittin' on a seesaw, hanging out with bull dogs and assorted pit frogs.
Put him down if ya don't know where he's been.
Pick him up if he's looking too thin.
Don't inhale or derail or curtail.
My train of thoughts overwrought, can't be bought.
You got me talkin' to myself, sweating in my sweater, underneath the weather.
No good-bye kiss or long love letter.
Don't orchestrate my life, just be-bop..."
Standing In My Way	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/standing_in_my_way-lyrics-102848.html	Debravation	"There's a banging in my head.
Every day I'm seeing red.
Feel I can do nothing at all til I break the chains, tear down the wall.
Too many people tell me what to do, what to think, and say.
Now it's time for me to do what I want.
You better get out of my way.
I'm moving out getting out of here.
I can't waste anymore time.
Pack my bags, tie my shoes, before I lose my mind.
You're standing standing in my way.
Well, don't say I didn't tell you.
No one hold me back.
I'm gonna do some climbing.
I'm pulling in the slack.
Lots of things to see and do and none of them include you.
I wrote your name on the bathroom wall.
You won't be lonely, everybody's gonna call.
Aw, you better move!
Too many people tell me what to do, what to think, and say.
Now it's time for me to do what I want.
You better get out of my way.
I'm moving out, getting out of here.
I can't waste anymore time.
Cause I know it's all out there and some of it is mine!
Yeah, that's right.
Better step aside.
Yeah, move it over.
Go on, get out of here."
Strike Me Pink	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/strike_me_pink-lyrics-102849.html	Debravation	"Everytime I meet you at the feet of Eros, we'll be in our street clothes and pretend we've never met, and I will tell you, ""My name is Angel"".
When you call me Angel I'll freeze like a statuette.
Mmm, they will point and say I look very real.
Yes they will.
I guess we all take turns on the water wheel.
Baby, last night you made me think, now strike me pink.
Maybe you'll bring me a lucky streak.
Well, strike me pink.
So what if our love is tragic; part of a missing link?
Baby your touch is magic.
You strike me pink.
I know that I'm in for a rude awakening.
Only you can make me come from behind the door.
Is it me or the earth that's shaking?
Only you can make me still come back for more.
Mmm, they will point and say I look very real, yes they will.
I guess we all take turns on the water wheel.
Mmm, they will point and say I look very real, yes they will.
I guess we all have turns on the wonder wheel."

Hey I saw your guy with a different girl
Looks like he's in another world
Run and hide sunday girl
Hurry up hurry up and wait
I stay away all week and still I wait
I got the blues
Please come see what your lovin means to me
She can't catch up with the working crowd
The weekend mood and she's feeling proud
Live in dreams sunday girl
Baby I would like to go out tonight
If I go with you my folks'll get uptight
Stay at home sunday girl
Hey, I saw your guy with different girl
Looks like he’s in another world
Run and hide Sunday girl
When I saw again in the summer time
If your love was as sweet as mine
I could be Sunday girl
Hurry up hurry up and wait
I stayed away all weekend
And still I wait
I got the blues, please come see what your loving means to me
Hurry up, hurry up hurry up and wait
I got the blues please, please
Please come see what you do to me
I got the blues
Hurry up,
Hurry up hurry up and wait.
Hurry up,
Please come see what you do to me"

Surrender	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/surrender-lyrics-102861.html	Koo Koo	"Surrender my love to you? Oh no. I won't surrender.
Surrender my love to you? Oh no. I won't.
Before I surrender my love to you I'd rather lie down in the street and get hit by a big Mack truck.
Surrender my love to you?
I'd rather sleep in a lion's den. Maybe then I'll have better luck.
I get so mad thinking of the chance you had.
You had my love, but you didn't want it then.
So now before I give you my love I'll need a better excuse to take that abuse again.
Surrender my love to you? Oh no. I won't surrender.
Surrender my love to you? Oh no. I won't.
Before I surrender my love to you I'd rather jump into the sea and be eaten by a big fat shark.
Surrender my love to you?
Like a hunter you never miss your mark.
I think this time you are gonna find you want my love, you'll have to take it.
So now come on and shoot your best shot.
Come on, give me all you got.
Surrender my love to you? Oh no. I won't surrender.
Surrender my love to you? Oh no. I won't."
Susie And Jeffrey	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/susie_and_jeffrey-lyrics-102862.html	Blonde Beyond	"Even though Jeff was worried
They weren't in a hurry
They planned a lovely honeymoon
Sue had a brand new Chevy
Conservative, in good taste
Only 30 payments due
They had outstanding tickets
They had no car insurance
But they had lots of things to do
They were getting organised
They had their plans all finalised
The date was set for Saturday
Susie and Jeffrey, they're gonna get married
They're going for a blood test
What if I don't pass my blood test?
What about our marriage licence?
What if I can't be deprogrammed?
Don't act like it's your last chance
We could have fun at the Spahn Ranch.
It's not like Gordon Avenue
Susie and Jeffrey, they're gonna get married
They're going for a blood test
Jeffrey said ""Let's wait""
Sue took her foot off of the brake
He drove into a wall
Don't get excited, now don't shout!
I'll scratch your eyes out
Now we can't have our honeymoon!""
Don't touch she's my fiance!
Say, but I like the way you play
An autograph from Orson Welles
I'm a fan, here's my record
It's one we can't get programmed
We want to give to all of you
They had a little argument
Sue took her foot off of the brake
He drove the car into a wall
They had a little argument
Sue took her foot off of the brake
He drove the car into a wall
They had a disagreement
Sue took her foot off of the brake
He drove the car into a wall"

The moon falls on the ground

Soldiers shoot all day

Everything is lost
Mankind is destroyed
Sprinkled in the void

The Beast	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/the_beast-lyrics-102870.html	The Hunter	"We want fun we wanna run
We want fun we gotta run
We want fun get out among the hottest clubs and find some love
Billions of people have heard of me and everyone knows
the sun rises in the East.
Not too nice, not too sweet, no-one even talks to me.
I shake the leaves right off the trees. I'm the bee's greasy knees.
I shake 'em, I break 'em, I drop 'em from eight miles high, alright
In the past my fate was cast, my social life was limited to Halloween
and New Years Eve, monotony was killing me, approaching schizophrenia.
I hit the hot spots every night and ...
for the first time in my life the bouncers would greet me,
the doormen would escort me, managers adored me.
Photographers would follow me begging for a smile;
""Beast, over here, Beast!"" ""Here, Beast!"" The hat check always said to me,
""Hiya B, whatcha doin' later?""
We want fun we gotta run
If you need fun get out and run
You need fun for feeling fine
We want fun for feeling fine and find the one ...
Now I'm not bragging. Heaven knows, I spend no more nights alone.
Lucky me, I'm ten foot three and freaky.
My picture's been reprinted, interviews requested one hundred times a week.
Believe it, I'm not talking through my teeth .....
Are you sure you got it, I mean it, to prove it I'm in the news.
It's true, it's true, check it out, check it out
He wants her love
She wants love
I take action, get relief, pick a partner, pick a piece, get satisfaction
I am the Beast, I am the Beast
She wants fun
He wants her love
I get satisfaction - I pick up my feet.
I'm the centre of attraction by staying off the streets
And I want love, get some funk and get some fun
Punks like fun, punks like funk
Funk is fun, we want fun"

I come down standing when I'm tossed in the air.
Bright as Tiajuana.
Like a dose of Bella Donna.
I could cry but I don't wanna.
And the dream's lost on me.
I come out shootin' when trouble comes knockin'.
I greet bad news by sending it walkin'.
Happy or just crazy.
Relaxed or laxy.
Gonna keep my vision hazy.
And the dream's lost on me.
Cares are all buckshot and buffalo.
Every dark has an afterglow.
I'm not afraid of what's down below.
I keep my sights on the sky.
I wake up laughing, thrown from a nightmare.
I come down standing when I'm tossed in the air.
Bright as Tiajuana.
Like a dose of Bella Donna.
I could cry but I don't wanna.
And the dream's lost on me.
I come out shootin' when trouble comes knockin'.
I greet bad news by sending it walkin'.
Happy or just crazy.

Give it up baby.
Give it to me.
I said give it up baby.

Like falling into a bottomless pit?
Committed crimes are pa-passionate And just when it gets so primitive, you hit the road like a fugitive.
Work me now!
Work me now!
Show me how!
Work me now!
Running scared's no way to live.
Hesitant and tentative.
Something else has got to give.
It can be so primitive!
Oh!
All in one night we'll scheme our way to the heavens.
You're captive in my grip.
You're watching time crawl by.
Attending to my needs.
Emotion boiling over, I count the explosions.
Then you hit the road like a fugitive!
Hey!
Work me now!
Oh baby show me how!
Work me now!
Work me now!
Staring for a moment as I sneak attack.
You run away.
I watch your back.
You got to make your getaway.
You better get it good.
You're just a primitive, a fugitive.
Whoa! I said work me now!
Come on and work me now!

And the world puts on a new face

And this whole world seems like a new face
Secretly I've been tailing you
Like a fox that preys on a rabbit
I had to get you and so I know
I had to learn your ways and habits
Oooooooooooyou were the catch that I was after
I looked up and I was in your arms
And I know that I was captured
What's this whole world coming to
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game
I had laid such a tender trap
Hoping you might fall into it
Love hit me with a sudden slap
One kiss and then I knew it
Ooooooooooomy plan didn't work out like I thought
I had laid my trap for you
But it seems that I got caught
What's this whole world coming to
Things just ain't the same
Anytime the hunter gets captured by the game"

Under Arrest	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/under_arrest-lyrics-102893.html	Koo Koo	"The name on the list didn't fit the ID.
Following clues.
You can't hide homicide.
They answer the phone, tell me they're not at home.
I'm doing my best to tell you what I know.
Meet me in an hour.
I'll be on the corner.
I'll have on a trenchcoat, naturally.
You cannot avoid me.
I can be annoying.
When you least expect it - ""answer the question now!""
Why inspector?
He's a fine detective.
Got his own perspective.
He's a lie detector.
Oh Heaven knows. Backtracking clues or any news on the scene.
In the right mood, sticking to my routine.
In dark day and night I'm like a machine.
It was someone he knew.
He let em in.
He got caught by a dirty doublecrosser capable of murder.
He's gonna be uncovered finally.
It's a full investigation and I'm very patient, working out the puzzle carefully.
You don't have to worry.
It could be scary.
Either ""Hit me Harry"" or a coronary.
Oh Heaven knows.
The face and the name didn't fit the ID.
The time and the place in evidence don't exist.
They wanna confess, and be blessed by the rope.
Hot on the scent finding only dead ends.
Now, the killer's out there.
Thinks he got away clear.
But he's not so clever.
He's going to the devil.
I'm setting up a rumour.
He's gonna walk into it, before he knows what happened.
I'm gonna grab him - tell me.
Why'd ya do it?
You're a pretty stupid jerk to try the heavy stuff.
You think your pretty tough.
Whoa, homicide.
You're under arrest, you're under arrest.
You're under arrest, you're under arrest.
Why'd ya do it?
You're pretty stupid.
The heavy stuff.
You're very tough.
You're under arrest."
Under The Gun  Jeffrey Lee Pierce	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/under_the_gun_jeffrey_lee_pierce-lyrics-102895.html	Live	"I still can picture him: his hands in his back pockets.
He wasn't much for words, but when the wise kids made a racket he'd just have to go downtown, throw his weight around before starting over.
Say did you hear I've got a band?
Some guys I know from L.A.
We'll own the Rio Grande.
I'll pay you back next Friday.
You know it sure ain't big, just some cats I dig.
They said they'd do the gig.
Oh Desperado, why don't you spend your life in Colorado?
Oh Restless Shadow, out in the blue hills you're feeling hollow.
Oh El Diablo, why did you spend your life in California?
I should have warned ya.
No place to go now but falling over.
Some hands can't make it on the run, under the gun.
Not for the younger.
Oh Jack Daniels, I feel your hunger.
I know you did your best, but you thought that you did not.
I wish that I had known before I heard the last shot.
You know, it's not a sin, that little badge of tin.
Just a momento.
So sad you loved in vain.
My comrades lost in battle.
The music wars are done from London to Seattle.
We all pay to play and all our yesterdays are starting over.
Oh Desperado, why don't you spend your life in Colorado?
Oh Restless Shadow, out on the blue hills you're feeling hollow.
Oh El Diablo, why did you spend your life in California?
I should have warned ya.
No place to go now but falling over.
Ready to die.
Now he's ready to die."
Under The Ice	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/under_the_ice-lyrics-102897.html	Heart On A Wall	"Run, run, run and hide away.
Hide in your apartment.
Never make a motion.
You don't want to.
Porcelin and macrame.
I can't believe your breathing.
All that stone emotion.
And he wants you.
He wants you so bad he can feel it like an order under his command.
A man is like an army when he wants to.
And you die a river every day.
Lying to your mirror.
Lie lie lie inside your head again, again.
Under the ice there's gotta be a fire.
In between every line, there's a liar.(?)
Swim in your heart, flow down to your fingers. (?)
And all over.(?)
Let it take a hold on.(?)
Hold on to me.
Oh hold on to me.
Send yourself on a holiday.
Everything's behind you.
Everything you take, you take inside you.
Send yourself so far away I can never find you.
(?) have no arms to put around you.
Under the ice there's gotta be a fire.
In between every line, there's a liar.(?)
Swim in your heart, flow out to your fingers. (?)
And all over.(?)
Let it take a hold on.(?)
Hold on to me."
Underground Girl	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/underground_girl-lyrics-102894.html	Blonde Beyond	"She's an underground girl in an underground world
She never comes around, she stays underground
After was a trip, she rides her lip
She's the coolest girl around, she's the girl from underground
She's the girl that's always right, she's the one who gets uptight
Ask her how she's been, she'll give you some skin
Hey everybody now from all over town
Hey everybody's gonna go underground
For everybody wants to be inside
And nobody knows she's gonna take you for a ride
She's the coolest girl around, she's the girl from underground
For I don't ant to brag, but I'm no dag
Ask her where she's from, she always playing dumb
Well hey now everybody don't fall down
Well hey everybody gotta go underground
Well hey everybody don't want to be inside
Nobody thinks she's gonna take you for a ride
She's the coolest girl around, she's the girl from underground
You can beat her with a whip, she just thinks it's hip
You can see her at night, never in the light
Well hey everybody gonna fall down
Well hey everybody gonna go underground
Well hey everybody wants to be inside
And nobody knows she's gonna take them for a ride
Here we go!"

Walk Like Me	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/walk_like_me-lyrics-102905.html	Autoamerican	"We don't wear that uniform;
paper men from pages torn right off the press (it could be Tass):
suits for the regime.
The media's gone and had a baby.
Seventh wave, another navy.
I live in America: gridlock on the street.
Tell that girl you like her badge.
Tell that man you're the Nazz.
Tell them you're not the last walking in parade.
Dressed to test you up the road.
Tighter than the latest clothes.
Close the circle, walk in row, walking in parade.
Why don't you walk like me?
Walk like me?
Walk like me?
Carrying the standard stick and marrying the politik.
You won't know tomorrow what went down today.
Look at me; I'm in tune: references around my room.
Just another secret school, another cycle going by.
You never looked like that.
Don't look like me.
Don't take it back.
You never had a name like that, never had a color.
Walking like a millionaire.
walking on imported air.
Change the way you comb your hair and watch what you walk under.
Why don't you walk like me?
Walk like me?
Walk like me?
Walk like me?"
War Child	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/war_child-lyrics-102907.html	Platinum Collection	"I need city lights
Defence and weaponry
No way of knowing
My life expectancy
I learn resistance
Like I learn to see
A living witness
A lonely refugee I'm a war child
I'm a war baby
And that's the difference
Between you and me
I'm a war child
My occupation
Is being occupied
I stop at the corner
To be identified
Across the border
They pretend victory
I'm playing in the rubble
And dream a destiny
I'm a war child
I'm a war baby
And that's the difference
Between you and me
I'm a war child
You weren't discovered by Khmer Rouge
We hear of ""the troubles"" on the nightly news
PLO lovers courting after the curfew
Your father and brother have the West Bank blues"

X Offender	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/x_offender-lyrics-102913.html	Blonde Beyond	"I saw you standing on the corner, you looked so big and fine.
I really wanted to go out with you, so when you smiled - I laid my heart on the line.
You read me my rights and then you said  Let's go  and nothing more.
I thought of my nights, and how they were.
They were filled with...
I know you wouldn't go.
You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in.
I had to know so I asked, you just had to laugh.
We sat in the night with my hands cuffed at my side.
I look at your life and your style...
I wanted nothing more.
I know you wouldn't go.
You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in.
I had to know so I asked, you just had to laugh.
Walking the line, you were a marksman.
Told me that law, like wine, is ageless.
Public defender...
You had to admit you wanted the love of a sex offender.
I know you wouldn't go.
You'd watch my heart burst then you'd step in.
I had to know so I asked, you just had to laugh.
My vision in blue, I call you from inside my cell.
And in the trial, you were there with your badge and rubber boots.
I think all the time how I'm going to perpatrate love with you.
And when I get out, there's no doubt I'll be sex offensive to you."

You, you got me in trouble.
Whatcha gonna do?
One end tied to your finger for remembering.
Who's the one likes to tease his kitten with the other end of the string?
But what ever it is, you got the biz.
I can't resist, no!
Two lines out to the life boats.
Your line's holding me.
Can't ya see that I'm counting on you while you're doing a number on me?
Divided by three, you're the singular something I need!
Don't care if it's new or even used in moderation.
Don't care if it's first or even second generation.
You better think of something!
You better think quick.

You look good in blue!

Youth Nabbed As Sniper	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/blondie/youth_nabbed_as_sniper-lyrics-102921.html	Plastic Letters	"Don't look in here, yeah
Sundown finds him out of town on the overpass
His inner self glued to his point twenty-two
Dirty metal in the speed of night, lights and broken glass
My heart can destroy all I see
Moving streets all make me lonely
Come to me and be mine only
I can hide us far from sight, but you must wait and I must fight this nothingness
Walls, I see my little room
I hear my parent's friends
I hope that my actions make amends
I would like to kill for love but I don't know how
Here I lie so high above the crowd
Busy streets all make me lonely
Come to me and be mine only
I can move us through the night, but you must wait and I must fight this emptiness
Black top burns with silent screams
Others stop my dreams
Lightning Crash! Crash! Crash!
Fear causes some to live, others die real cool
I died in the evening after school
Be mine only
Be my own
Be mine only
Be my own"
