Agitated	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/muse/agitated-lyrics-24683.html	Origin Of Symmetry	"ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Set Me Free
Let Me Be
Who And What I Am
Why Can't You See?
You Never Seem To Understand
This Pain I Feel Is As Real
As Your Ignorance
Question Fate
As I Await Deliverance
Like A Fantastic Fork
In Bloody Meat
Don't Give Me Love
I Wanna Drowned In Your Deep Divide
Tumbleweed Sew The Seed
In This Ghost Town
You Never Know
What You'll See
When The Sun Goes Down
I Saw Her Last
In A Dream
She Seems To Astound
Heard Of Her First Third Verse
(216) Hands Bound
Taken From Me
In My Mind Empty
Without It Inside
Starving I Am The Deprived
Just Want It Once...
desires Strong
Resistance Is Weak
It's Hard To Win
When You've Got So Many Mouths To Feed
I Could Die
For All Of My Sins
No Not For That
For All That I Have Never Had
This Life's A Fight
For Fulfillment Inside
A War Of My Own Hindsight
Look Back With Resentment
Taken As I Find Myself
All Alone
Taken From Me"

Sunburn	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/muse/sunburn-lyrics-24657.html	Showbiz	"Come waste your millions here
Secretly she sneers
Another corporate show
A guilty conscience grows
And I'll feel
A guilty conscience grow
And I'll feel
A guilty conscience grow
She burns like the sun and I can't look away
She'll burn our horizons
Make no mistake
Come let the truth be shared
No one ever dared
To break these endless lies
Secretly she cries
She burns like the sun and I can't look away
She'll burn our horizons
Make no mistake
I'll hide from the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll run forever
I can't face the shame
I'll hide form the world
Behind a broken frame
And I'll run forever
I can't face the shame"
The Groove	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/muse/the_groove-lyrics-214321.html	-	"So Here it is again
The way that thing is put
To break the Public's fall
Someone tell me who takes the Prize
And who takes the Fall
-Chorus-
So Confused!
When your Lost in The Groove!
So Confused!
When your Lost in The Groove
And Down Time Comes Again
And her Masks are Shifting
Like a Chameleon
Someone tell me when She Breaks the Fall
And tell me when she breaks my Heart
-Chorus-
Woooo!

Thoughts Of A Dying Atheist	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/muse/thoughts_of_a_dying_atheist-lyrics-199854.html	Absolution	"In your whispers
Trapped beneath my pillow
You won't let me see
Your memories
And I know you're in this room

Frozen in between
Where our worlds collide
Scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
Yeah yeah yeah...
And I know the moment's near
And there's nothing you can do
Look for your faith inside
Are you afraid to die?
It scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see
And it scares the hell out of me
And the end is all I can see

It scares the hell out of me

asphyxiating
I wanna break the spell
that you've created
you're something beautiful
a contradiction
I wanna play the game
I want the friction

the death of me
yeah, you will be
the death of me
bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
our time is running out
and our time is running out
you can't push it underground
we can't stop it screaming out
I wanted freedom
but I'm restricted
I tried to give you up
but I'm addicted
now that you know I'm trapped
sense of elation
you'll never dream of breaking this fixation
you will squeeze the life out of me
bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it
our time is running out
and our time is running out
you can't push it underground
we can't stop it screaming out
how did it come to this
you will suck the life out of me
bury it
I won't let you bury it
I won't let you smother it
I won't let you murder it

you can't push it underground
we can't stop it screaming out

Undisclosed Desires	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/muse/undisclosed_desires-lyrics-1317114.html	The Resistance	"I know you've suffered
But I don't want you to hide
It's cold and loveless
I won't let you be denied
Soothing
I'll make you feel pure
Trust me
You can be sure
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart
You trick your lovers
That you're wicked and divine
You may be a sinner
But your innocence is mine
Please me
Show me how it's done
Tease me
You are the one
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart
Please me
Show me how it's done
Trust me
You are the one
I want to reconcile the violence in your heart
I want to recognise your beauty's not just a mask
I want to exorcise the demons from your past
I want to satisfy the undisclosed desires in your heart"
Unintended	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/muse/unintended-lyrics-24663.html	Showbiz	"You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You could be the one I'll always love
You could be the one who listens
To my deepest inquisitions
You could be the one I'll always love
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before
First there was the one who challenged
All my dreams and all my balance
She could never be as good as you
You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You could be the one I'll always love
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before
Before you"
United States Of Eurasia / Collateral Damage	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/muse/united_states_of_eurasia_collateral_damage-lyrics-1317115.html	The Resistance	"You and me are the same
We don't know or care who's to blame
But we know that whoever holds the reigns
Nothing will change
Our cause has gone insane
And these wars they can't be won
And these wars they can't be won
And do you want them to go on and on and on?
Why split these states
When there can be only one
And must we do as we're told?
Must we do as we're told?
You and me fall in line
To be punished for unproven crimes
And we know that there's no one we can trust
Our ancient heroes
They are turning to dust
And these wars they can't be won
Does anyone know or care how they begun?
They just promise to go on and on and on
But soon we will see
There can be only one
United States

Eurasia! Sia! Sia! Sia!
Eurasia! Sia! Sia! Sia!
Eurasia! Sia! Sia! Sia!"
Unnatural Selection	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/muse/unnatural_selection-lyrics-1317117.html	The Resistance	"They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No chance for fate
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth
I'm hungry for some unrest
I want to push this beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that they'll understand
Dedication to a new age
Is this the end of destruction and rampage?
Another chance to erase then repeat it again
Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean
Ocean
They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No (Hey) chance (Hey) for fate (Hey)
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth
No religion or mind virus
Is there a hope that the facts will ever find us?
Just make sure that you're are looking out for number one
I'm hungry for some unrest
Let's push this beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that you will understand
Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean
Ocean
They'll laugh as they watch us crawl
The lucky don't share at all
No (Hey) hope (Hey) for fate (Hey)
It's a random chance selection
I want the truth
Try to ride out the storm
Whilst they'll make you believe
They are the special ones (We have not been chosen)
Injustice is the norm
You won't be the first
And you know you won't be the last
Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean
Ocean, ocean, ocean
They'll laugh as they watch us fall
And the lucky they don't care at all
No (Hey) chance (Hey) for fate (Hey)
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth, I want the truth
I want the truth, I want the truth"
Uno	https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/muse/uno-lyrics-24664.html	Showbiz	"This means nothing to me
Cos you are nothing to me
And it means nothing to me
That you blew this away
Cos you could have been number one
If you only found the time
And you could have ruled the whole world
If you'd had the chance
You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away
You're still nothing to me
And this is nothing to me
And you don't know what you've done
But I'll give you a clue
You could have been number one
If you'd only had the chance
And you could have ruled the whole world
If you'd had the time
You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun
But you blew it away
You could have been number one
And you could have ruled the whole world
And we could have had so much fun

YES PLEASE! Ha! Ha!
I cannot sleep,
There's too much noise in my head!
I cannot sleep,
I want it here instead!
I never thought that this could come to this.
I just wanna look at your face in peace now.
You'll never miss.
But I can...
I cannot keep
The shame that's clawed us out!
I will not keep
Your shut-up, shut-up lies!
I never thought that this could come to this.
I just wanna live in bliss, in peace now.
You will never miss.
But I can..."
