Come tonight, Come to the ogre site, Come to the ogre battle fight\\nThe ogre men are still inside, The two way mirror mountain\\nYou gotta keep down, right out of sight\\nYou can't see in but they can see out, 'keep a look out'\\nThe ogre men are coming out, from the two way mirror mountain\\nThey're running up behind, and they're coming all about\\nCan't go east because you gotta go south\\nOgre men are coming home, the great big fight is over\\nBugle blow let trumpet cry, Ogre battle lives for ever more\\nYou can come along, You can come along...
